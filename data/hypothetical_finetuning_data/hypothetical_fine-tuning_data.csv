Do sleep spindle and slow wave frequency reflect motor skill performance in primary school-age children?,"Children enhance their accuracy only over an interval with sleep. Unlike previously reported in adults, children enhance their speed independent of sleep, a capacity that may to be lost in adulthood. Individual differences in the dominant frequency of spindles and slow waves were predictive for performance: children performed better if they had less slow spindles, more fast spindles and faster slow waves. On the other hand, overnight enhancement of accuracy was most pronounced in children with more slow spindles and slower slow waves, i.e., the ones with an initial lower performance. Associations of spindle and slow wave characteristics with initial performance may confound interpretation of their involvement in overnight enhancement. Slower frequencies of characteristic sleep events may mark slower learning and immaturity of networks involved in motor skills."

Do sleep spindle and slow wave frequency reflect motor skill performance in primary school-age children?,"Children enhance their accuracy only over an interval with sleep. Unlike previously reported in adults, children enhance their speed independent of sleep, a capacity that may to be lost in adulthood. Individual differences in the dominant frequency of spindles and slow waves were predictive for performance: children performed better if they had less slow spindles, more fast spindles and faster slow waves. On the other hand, overnight enhancement of accuracy was most pronounced in children with more slow spindles and slower slow waves, i.e., the ones with an initial lower performance. Associations of spindle and slow wave characteristics with initial performance may confound interpretation of their involvement in overnight enhancement. Slower frequencies of characteristic sleep events may mark slower learning and immaturity of networks involved in motor skills."

These findings can inform efforts to explore the reasons behind these differences and develop preventive interventions for high-risk patients.
Is cerebral inflammation an underlying mechanism of early death in Alzheimer 's disease : a 13-year cause-specific multivariate mortality study?,"This is the first study to link neuroinflammation independently to early death in AD and, hence, a rapidly progressing disease. Frontal and medial temporal atrophies and low cognition were also significant predictors. These are probably downstream biomarkers that reflect neuronal degeneration and late-stage disease. Our results suggest that inflammation, and not amyloid or tau pathology, is an independent underlying mechanism in the malignancy of AD."
Is mitochondria inheritance a key factor for tolerance to dehydration in wine yeast production?,"In modern oenology, yeast starters are employed to inoculate grape juice, usually in the form of active dry yeast (ADY). The dehydration process implies stressful conditions that lead to oxidative damage. Other yeast species and interspecific hybrids other than Saccharomyces cerevisiae may be used to confer novel properties to the final product. However, these yeasts are usually more sensitive to drying. Understanding the causes of oxidative stress tolerance is therefore necessary for developing the use of these organisms in industry. This study indicates the impact of mitochondrial DNA inheritance for oxidative stress resistance in an interspecific context using isogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae × Saccharomyces uvarum hybrids."
Does catecholamine release induce elevation in plasma lactate levels in patients undergoing adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma?,"Catecholamine release caused by surgical manipulation may be a possible cause of intraoperative transient lactic acidosis, and it should be considered as a differential diagnosis of intraoperative lactic acidosis.

Does targeting factor VIII expression to platelets for hemophilia A gene therapy induce an apparent thrombotic risk in mice?,"Background Targeting factor (F) VIII expression to platelets is a promising gene therapy approach for hemophilia A, and is successful even in the presence of inhibitors. It is well known that platelets play important roles not only in hemostasis, but also in thrombosis and inflammation. Objective To evaluate whether platelet-FVIII expression might increase thrombotic risk and thereby compromise the safety of this approach. Methods In this study, platelet-FVIII-expressing transgenic mice were examined either in steady-state conditions or under prothrombotic conditions induced by inflammation or the FV Leiden mutation. Native whole blood thrombin generation assay, rotational thromboelastometry analysis and ferric chloride-induced vessel injury were used to evaluate the hemostatic properties. Various parameters associated with thrombosis risk, including D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, fibrinogen, tissue fibrin deposition, platelet activation status and activatability, and platelet-leukocyte aggregates, were assessed. Results We generated a new line of transgenic mice that expressed 30-fold higher levels of platelet-expressed FVIII than are therapeutically required to restore hemostasis in hemophilic mice. Under both steady-state conditions and prothrombotic conditions induced by lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammation or the FV Leiden mutation, supratherapeutic levels of platelet-expressed FVIII did not appear to be thrombogenic. Furthermore, FVIII-expressing platelets were neither hyperactivated nor hyperactivatable upon agonist activation. Conclusion We conclude that, in mice, more than 30-fold higher levels of platelet-expressed FVIII than are required for therapeutic efficacy in hemophilia A are not associated with a thrombotic predilection."

However, multicenter, prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and ultimately test the value of such protein panels in perioperative management and decision making."
Does greater body mass independently predict less radiographic progression on X-ray and MRI over 1-2 years?,Greater BMI is associated with a lower risk of progression on X-ray and MRI over 2 years. Subjects with greater BMI also demonstrate less bone oedema at baseline. Greater BMI may indicate a less aggressive RA phenotype and aid in risk stratification.
Does comparison of gene expression microarray data with count-based RNA measurements inform microarray interpretation?,Microarray measurements generally correlate with relative RNA molecule counts within optimal ranges but suffer from expression-dependent accuracy bias and precision that varies across datasets. We urge microarray users to consider expression-level effects in signal interpretation and to evaluate noise properties in each dataset independently.
Is a novel BHLHE41 variant associated with short sleep and resistance to sleep deprivation in humans?,"There are a number of mutations of BHLHE41. Mutations reduce total sleep while maintaining NREM sleep and provide resistance to the effects of sleep loss. Mutations that affect sleep also modify the normal inhibition of BHLHE41 of CLOCK/BMAL1 transactivation. Thus, clock mechanisms are likely involved in setting sleep length and the magnitude of sleep homeostasis."
"Is subcortical atrophy associated with cognitive impairment in mild Parkinson disease : a combined investigation of volumetric changes , cortical thickness , and vertex-based shape analysis?","Patients with Parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment demonstrated reduced subcortical volumes, which were associated with cognitive deficits.

Do obese children and adolescents need increased gastric volumes in order to perceive satiety?,Obese children and adolescents need to ingest greater volumes to feel full which may predispose toward the consumption of larger portion sizes. This may easily lead to overeating if predominantly energy-dense foods are consumed. A reduction in energy-dense foods in the diet of obese children and adolescents appears to be a necessary strategy for managing body weight.
Does anesthetic preconditioning inhibit isoflurane-mediated apoptosis in the developing rat brain?,"The ISO-mediated increase in cleaved caspase-3 in the postnatal day 7 rat brain is ameliorated by PC with a brief anesthetic exposure, and differences were not detected in other markers of neuronal injury."
Is human fetal growth constrained below optimal for perinatal survival?,"From an immediate survival perspective, optimal fetal growth requires a birth weight between the 80(th) and 84(th) centiles for the population. Median birth weight in the population is, by definition, substantially lower than these centiles, implying that the majority of fetuses exhibit some form of maternal constraint on growth. This finding is consistent with adaptations that have evolved in humans in conjunction with a large head and bipedalism, to reduce the risk of obstructed delivery. These data also fit remarkably well with those on long-term adult cardiovascular and metabolic health risks, which are lowest in cases with a birth weight around the 90(th) centile."
Is spa typing alone sufficient to demonstrate endemic establishment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a low-prevalence country?,"MRSA spa type t304 appears to have established itself as an endemic genetic lineage in the study area. spa typing does not provide sufficient resolution when investigating the spread of an endemic-like genetic lineage in a low-prevalence area, and should be supplemented by additional typing techniques."
"Is neoplastic progression in short-segment Barrett 's oesophagus associated with impairment of chemical clearance , but not inadequate acid suppression by proton pump inhibitor therapy?","Neoplastic progression in SSBO is associated with impairment of chemical clearance, but not inadequate acid suppression by PPI therapy. Neoplastic progression in SSBO can be predicted by a low PSPW index."
Is stemness Derived from Thyroid Cancer Cells?,"Our findings support our earlier hypothesis that stemness in thyroid cancer is derived via EMT rather than from resident thyroid stem cells. In mice with a thyroid-specific knock-in of oncogenic Braf (LSL-Braf((V600E))/TPO-Cre), the neoplastic changes were dependent on thyroid cell differentiation and the onset of stemness must have been derived from differentiated thyroid epithelial cells. Furthermore, celastrol suppressed TGF-β1 induced EMT in thyroid cancer cells and may have therapeutic potential."

Does an accelerated infliximab induction regimen reduce the need for early colectomy in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis?,"In patients with ASUC, an accelerated infliximab induction strategy reduces the need for early colectomy. An intensified infliximab dosing strategy in response to clinical or laboratory signs of breakthrough inflammation merits consideration in prospective studies."
Does cT substitute derived from MR images reconstructed with parallel imaging?,"SPIRiT marginally improved the CT substitute quality for a given number of radial spokes as compared to gridding. However, the increased reconstruction time of non-Cartesian parallel imaging reconstruction is difficult to motivate from this improvement. Because the CT substitute algorithm was insensitive to moderate subsampling, data for a CT substitute could be collected in as little as minute and reconstructed with gridding without deteriorating the CT substitute quality."
Does [ Inflammation promote the development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer ]?,Inflammation can promote the colitis-associated CAC. And the activation of STAT3 signal pathway may promote the development of CAC.

Does pINK1 trigger autocatalytic activation of Parkin to specify cell fate decisions?,Autocatalytic activation of Parkin bolsters its accumulation on mitochondria and apoptotic response to valinomycin. Our results suggest that PINK1-Parkin constitutes a damage-gated molecular switch that governs cellular-context-specific cell fate decisions in response to variable stress stimuli.
Does short-term glucocorticoid treatment cause spinal osteoporosis in ovariectomized rats?,"Short-term glucocorticoid treatment of ovariectomized rats indicates according to DEXA standards a severe osteoporotic bone status in vertebral bone. Nonetheless, dysfunctional bone anabolism and enhanced bone catabolism are observed. Alterations of bone extracellular matrix proteins that correlate to inferior mechanical stability and affected microstructure were noticed and suggest further investigation. Treatment with dexamethasone was also seen to affect insulin and osteopontin levels and thus osteoblast function and maturation. This described animal model presents a recapitulation of clinically obtained data from early phase glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis observed in patients."
Does caffeine modify blood glucose availability during prolonged low-intensity exercise in individuals with type-2 diabetes?,Supplementation with 1.5 mg/kg of caffeine reduces BG concentration during prolonged exercise in T2DM patients.

The high BMC in these patients is partially explained by high lean mass and tall stature."
Does the PROMIS physical function correlate with the QuickDASH in patients with upper extremity illness?,"The PROMIS Physical Function instrument may be used as an upper extremity disability measure, as it correlates with the QuickDASH questionnaire, and both instruments are influenced most strongly by the degree to which pain interferes with achieving goals."
Is unilateral hearing loss associated with a negative effect on language scores in adolescents?,"These findings suggest that UHL in adolescents is associated with a negative effect on standardized language scores and IQ. They also demonstrate that the developmental gap between children with UHL and children with NH does not resolve as the children progress into adolescence and may even widen as the children grow older. Therefore, these results strongly encourage implementation of early intervention for children with UHL to prevent speech-language delays. More studies in adolescents are warranted to evaluate educational outcomes."
Does relative influence of genetics and shared environment on child mental health symptoms depend on comorbidity?,"We conclude that symptom classes are largely similar across sexes in middle childhood. Heritability was moderate for all classes, but shared environment played a greater role for classes in which no one type of symptom predominated."

Is obstacle crossing with dual tasking a danger for individuals with Alzheimer 's disease and for healthy older people?,"The behavior of the healthy elderly subjects and individuals with AD was similar for obstacle crossing during walking with dual tasking. Both groups used the ""posture first"" strategy to prioritize stability and showed decreased attention to executive tasking while walking. Additionally, AD had a strong influence on the modifications that are made by the elderly while walking under different walking conditions."
Does telecytopathology for on-site adequacy evaluation decrease the nondiagnostic rate in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic lesions?,"Telecytopathology on-site evaluation of EUS-FNA of pancreatic lesions reduces the nondiagnostic rate, especially in lesions with solid characteristics, and may serve as an effective substitute for on-site evaluation by a cytopathologist."
Does automated auditory mismatch negativity paradigm improve coma prognostic accuracy after cardiac arrest and therapeutic hypothermia?,"This automated ADP significantly improves early coma prognostic accuracy after cardiac arrest and therapeutic hypothermia. The progression of auditory discrimination is strongly predictive of favorable recovery and appears complementary to existing prognosticators of poor outcome. Before routine implementation, validation on larger cohorts is warranted."

Do myofibroblasts from salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinomas promote cancer invasion by expressing MMP2 and CXCL12?,"This study demonstrated the presence of myofibroblasts in ACC. Myofibroblasts might be related to the aggressive growth behaviour of ACC, owing to their high levels of expression of MMP2 and CXCL12."
Is the macrophage activation marker sCD163 associated with changes in NAFLD and metabolic profile during lifestyle intervention in obese children?,"sCD163 was associated with markers of liver injury and metabolic parameters in obese children, and changes in these parameters during lifestyle intervention. This may suggest that activated macrophages play a role in NAFLD and sCD163 may serve as a marker of liver disease severity and treatment effect."
Does dkk-1-mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling in bone ameliorate osteoarthritis in mice?,"Wnt activation in OA affects the whole joint, particularly bone. Selective inhibition of this pathway in bone by Dkk-1 decreased OA severity through VEGF inhibition."
Does diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging indicate the severity of acute pancreatitis?,"DW-MRI was a compatible and safe image option to differentiate tissue image patterns in patients with mAP, nAP, and nP, mainly in those with contraindications to contrast-enhanced MRI (which is classically required for determining the presence of necrosis) or computed tomography. ADC measures allowed precise differentiation between patterns 1, 2, and 3."
Does inhibition of notch signaling in combination with Paclitaxel reduce platinum-resistant ovarian tumor growth?,Inhibiting the Notch signaling cascade with a GSI reduces primary human xenograft growth in vivo. GSI synergized with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy only in the platinum-resistant OvCa models with single agent paclitaxel. These findings suggest inhibition of the Notch pathway in concert with taxane therapy may hold promise for treatment of platinum-resistant OvCa.
Is iPS cell-derived cardiogenicity hindered by sustained integration of reprogramming transgenes?,"A disproportionate stemness load, caused by integrated transgenes, affects the cardiogenic competency of iPS cells. Offload of transgenes in engineered iPS cells ensures integrity of cardiac developmental programs, underscoring the value of nonintegrative nuclear reprogramming for derivation of competent cardiogenic regenerative biologics."
Does discovery-based protein expression profiling identify distinct subgroups and pathways in leiomyosarcomas?,These results suggest that UPS tumors share a similar lineage as leiomyosarcomas and are likely to originate from different stages of differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells to smooth muscle cells.
Is downregulation of microRNAs 145-3p and 145-5p a long-term predictor of postmenopausal breast cancer risk : The ORDET prospective study?,These observations and the prospective design of our study lend support to the hypothesis that downregulation of specific miRNAs constitutes an early event in cancer development. This finding might be used for breast cancer prevention.
Is childhood maltreatment associated with depression but not with hypochondriasis in later life?,The findings suggest a robust association of childhood maltreatment with depression but not with hypochondriasis.

Does meta-analysis show that infants who have suffered neonatal sepsis face an increased risk of mortality and severe complications?,"Infants who have suffered neonatal sepsis face an increased risk of mortality and severe complications such as brain damage and, or, neurodevelopmental delay."
Does environmental enrichment restore cognitive deficits induced by experimental childhood meningitis?,"The data presented suggest that EE, a non-invasive therapy, enables recovery from memory deficits caused by neonatal meningitis."
Does proper timing of adjuvant chemotherapy affect survival in patients with stage 2 and 3 gastric cancer?,"There is insufficient evidence to suggest starting adjuvant chemotherapy within 4 weeks after surgery for patients with D2 resected stage 2 and 3 gastric cancer. However, delayed treatment of adjuvant chemotherapy after 8 weeks showed worse survival outcomes than early and intermediate treatment initiation, suggesting that adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered start within 8 weeks after radical resection."
Does dexmedetomidine inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglia by suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase?,Dexmedetomidine attenuates NO and iNOS accumulation by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in both BV2 cells and primary microglial cells.
Is single cell segmental aneuploidy detection compromised by S phase?,"The results demonstrate that the accuracy to detect segmental chromosomal imbalances is reduced in S-phase cells, which could be a source of misdiagnosis in PGD. Hence, the cell cycle phase of the analyzed cell is of great importance and should be taken into account during the analysis. This knowledge may guide future technological improvements."
Do surgeons often underestimate the amount of blood loss in replacement surgeries?,"This study has shown that using clinical estimation alone to guide blood transfusion is inadequate. In this study, 70% of patients had their blood loss underestimated, proving that surgeons often underestimate blood loss in replacement surgeries."
Does fatigue correlate with the decrease in parasympathetic sinus modulation induced by a cognitive challenge?,The methods described here are useful for assessing the association between fatigue sensation and autonomic nerve activity using a brief cognitive test in healthy females.
Does cT angiography spot sign in intracerebral hemorrhage predict active bleeding during surgery?,"The CTA spot sign is associated with more intraoperative bleeding, more postoperative rebleeding, and larger residual ICH volumes in patients undergoing hematoma evacuation for spontaneous ICH. The spot sign may therefore be useful to select patients for future surgical trials."
Does the RNA editing enzyme APOBEC1 induce somatic mutations and a compatible mutational signature is present in esophageal adenocarcinomas?,"Our findings suggest that the ability of APOBEC1 to trigger genetic alterations represents a major layer in its oncogenic potential. Such APOBEC1-induced mutator phenotypes could play a role in the onset of esophageal adenocarcinomas. APOBEC1 could be involved in cancer promotion at the very early stages of carcinogenesis, as it is highly expressed in Barrett's esophagus, a condition often associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma."
Are suboptimal breastfeeding practices associated with infant illness in Vietnam?,Early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding protects against diarrhea and ARI. Results confirm that interventions to improve early and exclusive breastfeeding would contribute to improving child health and nutrition in Vietnam.
Is sleep disturbance after fracture related to emotional well-being rather than functional result?,"At 12-month follow-up, poor sleep was independently associated with poor emotional status but not associated with poor functional status. The mental health status of patients with sleep difficulty in the latter stages of fracture healing should be carefully assessed to provide the highest level of care. The results of this study should allow orthopaedic trauma surgeons to counsel patients regarding expectations of difficulty sleeping after acute fractures."
Is serum vitamin D associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Chinese males with normal weight and liver enzymes?,"The present study demonstrated that serum 25(OH)D3 levels were inversely associated with NAFLD, even in subjects with normal total body fat, suggesting a potential role of lower levels of vitamin D in the occurrence and development of NAFLD."
Do pilot study of glaucoma drainage implant surgery supplemented with reticulated hyaluronic acid gel in severe glaucoma?,"In eyes with severe glaucoma, the intraoperative application of crosslinked sodium HA gel may improve the efficacy of GDI surgery."
Does prediction of Thorough QT study result using action potential simulations based on ion channel screens?,"This study provides a proof-of-principle for the prediction of human TQT study results using data available early in drug development. We highlight a number of areas that need refinement to improve the method's predictive power, but the results suggest that such approaches will provide a useful tool in cardiac safety assessment."
Do serum testosterone levels decrease in middle age in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome?,"Hyperandrogenism partly resolves before menopause in women with PCOS. This change may explain the tendency of women with PCOS to cycle regularly as they grow older. Testosterone levels remain elevated in older women with PCOS, however, and may contribute to their increased risk for cardiovascular disease, endometrial cancer, and other diseases."
Is detection of micrometastatic prostate cancer cells in the lymph nodes by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction predictive of biochemical recurrence in pathological stage T2 prostate cancer?,Nested RT-PCR of the lymph nodes may be a useful pretreatment prognostic test for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Further research is necessary using a much larger number of patients with a longer followup.
Do repeated ECS and fluoxetine administration have equivalent effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity?,"Given that fluoxetine and rECS share antidepressant properties, but differ in their effects on learning and memory, we propose that the common effects on dentate connectivity and synaptic plasticity described here are more likely to relate to affective rather than cognitive function. This result is consistent with other experiments showing that a reduction in dentate connectivity correlates with stress susceptibility in animals."
Does screening women with a family history of breast cancer -- result from the British Familial Breast Cancer Group?,This study provides evidence to suggest that screening young women with a significant family history of breast cancer is effective and that a survival benefit can be expected. As a result the British Familial Breast Cancer Group proposes a co-ordinated prospective observational study.
Do vasoactive agents modulate migration of monocytes across glomerular endothelial cells?,Vasoactive agents directly modulate the transmigration of monocytes. The present in vitro study provides a basis for a hypothesis that vasoactive agents may also be modulating the migration of monocytes across the glomerular endothelial cell layer (into the mesangium).
Does [ Thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer decrease after vitreous surgery for idiopathic macular hole ]?,"This study demonstrates that the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer decreases at least one month after surgery, even in cases without visual field defect. This fact may suggest the existence of a subclinical complication of vitreous surgery."
Do systemic estrogens have no conclusive beneficial effect on human skin connective tissue?,"Accordingly, several studies have been accomplished, in which hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been used in order to prevent skin aging at or after the menopause. In this overview the results of previous studies, and a study done recently, are critically reviewed."
Are outcomes after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin affected by substaging of high grade T1 transitional cell carcinoma?,"Substaging of T1 tumors did not affect response to BCG in regard to recurrence or progression. Therefore, intravesical BCG is effective for stages T1a and T1b disease."
Is altered synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of the castrated male mouse reversed by testosterone replacement?,Suppression of PPF and impairment of the potentiation by PBS in CA1 hippocampal neurons was observed in castrated male mice and these changes were reversed by testosterone injection. These findings suggest that altered synaptic transmission in the castrated male mouse is caused by disturbance of inhibitory neuronal networks that are influenced by testosterone.
Does hyperthermia prevent metabolic and cerebral flow responses to hypoxia in the fetal sheep?,"When temperature of the fetal sheep is elevated, as may occur with maternal fever, prolonged exercise, and elevated environmental temperatures, the fetal brain is less well protected against hypoxic injury."
Do event-related brain potentials distinguish processing stages involved in face perception and recognition?,"While the N170 reflects the pre-categorical structural encoding of faces, the 'N400f' and 'P600f' are likely to indicate subsequent processes involved in face recognition. Impaired structural encoding can result in the disruption of face identification. This is illustrated by a neuropsychological case study, demonstrating the absence of the N170 and later ERP indicators of face recognition in a prosopagnosic patient."
Do scanning laser densitometry and color perimetry demonstrate reduced photopigment density and sensitivity in two patients with retinal degeneration?,"Scanning laser densitometry with a modified Rodenstock SLO is a useful method to assess the human photopigment distribution. Densitometry results were confirmed by dark adapted two color static perimetry. Photopigment distribution and retinal sensitivity profiles can be measured with high spatial resolution. This may help to measure exactly the temporal development of retinal diseases and to test the success of different therapeutic treatments. Both methods have limitations at the present state of development. However, some of these limitations can be overcome by further improving the instruments."
Are cerebrospinal fluid corticotropin-releasing hormone levels elevated in monkeys with patterns of brain activity associated with fearful temperament?,"These findings suggest that, in primates, the fearful endophenotype is characterized by increased fearful behavior, a specific pattern of frontal electrical activity, increased pituitary-adrenal activity, and increased activity of brain CRH systems. Data from other preclinical studies suggests that the increased brain CRH activity may underlie the behavioral and physiological characteristics of fearful endophenotype."
Does bone mineral density vary as a function of the rate of joint space narrowing in the hip?,"Patients with a rapid rate of JSN of the asymptomatic hip after unilateral THR are characterized by elevated local and remote BMD. The local elevation in BMD implies that increased local bone density may contribute to or serve as a marker for increased risk of development of OA (assuming that JSN can be used as a predictive marker). The presence of elevated BMD in the spine suggests that there are systemic as well as local aspects of OA pathogenesis, at least in patients with one THR and rapid JSN in the contralateral hip."
Do increased levels of GALbeta1-4GLCNACalpha2-6 sialyltransferase pretransplant predict delayed graft function in kidney transplant recipients?,ST6GalI levels are high in renal failure patients awaiting a renal transplant and may be a risk factor for the development of delayed graft function. The assessment and perhaps modulation of a potential transplant recipient's ST6GalI systemic level may be beneficial.
Is prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis in urine of male patients with ankylosing spondylitis increased?,"The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis infections, as detected by commercially available DNA amplification assays in urine specimens, in AS patients is not higher compared with male controls of the same age. However, there seems to be an association between specific antibodies to C trachomatis and AAU."
Is ultradian rapid cycling in prepubertal and early adolescent bipolarity in transmission disequilibrium with val/met COMT alleles?,"The lack of linkage disequilibrium between l-COMT and ultradian rapid cycling in the PEA-BP sample compared to reported findings of an association in case-control studies of adults is discussed in terms of age-specific developmentally relevant phenotypes, anticipatory mechanisms, and heterogeneity. Repeat TDT analyses after these PEA-BP probands reach their adult phenotypes will be informative."
Is infection with virulent strains of Helicobacter pylori associated with ischaemic heart disease : evidence from a population-based case-control study of myocardial infarction?,"Infection with the more virulent strains of H. pylori, as with all strains, is not associated with myocardial infarction."
Does the luminal short-chain fatty acid butyrate modulate NF-kappaB activity in a human colonic epithelial cell line?,These findings suggest that the influences of butyrate on colonic inflammatory responses may result in part from its influence on NF-kappaB activation. This activity of butyrate apparently involves its ability to inhibit deacetylases.
Do veteran athletes exercise at higher maximum heart rates than are achieved during standard exercise ( stress ) testing?,"Maximal HR in veteran athletes during specific sporting activities was significantly higher than that attained during a routine sECG. This finding was not sport-specific, nor was it related to the level of competitiveness of the trial participants. These data show that a routine sECG is a submaximal test of exercise performance, and should be interpreted as such."
Does intradialytic glucose infusion increase polysulphone membrane permeability and post-dilutional haemodiafiltration performances?,We conclude that intravenous glucose administration during high-flux HDF using polysulphone membranes increases significantly both ultrafiltration capacity and dialysis dose delivery.
Is area under the serum creatinine time-curve a strong predictor of chronic renal allograft rejection?,To reduce the risk of developing chronic rejection after renal transplantation acute rejection episodes during the first 3 months should be avoided as much as possible.
"Is response to methotrexate in early rheumatoid arthritis associated with a decrease of T cell derived tumour necrosis factor alpha , increase of interleukin 10 , and predicted by the initial concentration of interleukin 4?","During treatment of RA with MTX the percentage of TNFalpha producing T cells decreases whereas that of IL10 producing T cells increases. This may affect macrophage activation and, therefore, may represent a regulatory mechanism relevant to disease remission. Furthermore, the percentage of IL4 positive CD4(+) T cells at disease onset may be a useful prognostic marker."
Is depression strongly associated with alexithymia in the general population?,These results suggest that alexithymia has a close relationship to depression in the general population. The impact of social factors on alexithymia may be primarily explained by depression. Depression must be taken into account as a confounding factor when studying alexithymia in general populations due to the strong association between alexithymia and depression.
Are memory disturbances in `` Ecstasy '' users correlated with an altered brain serotonin neurotransmission?,Our preliminary results may indicate altered 5-HT neuronal function with correlated memory impairment in abstinent MDMA users.
Does propofol directly depress lumbar dorsal horn neuronal responses to noxious stimulation in goats?,"These data indicate that propofol has a direct depressant effect on dorsal horn neuronal responses to noxious stimulation, with little or no indirect supraspinal effect."
Do an update in the palliative management of malignant dysphagia?,"Palliative treatment for oesophageal cancer should be individualized and relate to tumour stage, size and location, the patient's medical condition and his/her personal wishes. The palliative treatment largely includes self-expanding metal stents (SEMS), laser (including photodynamic therapy (PDT)) or a combination of the two to relieve symptoms, this may be employed with or without other treatments such as radiotherapy/chemotherapy (RT/CT) with the aim of reducing tumour bulk and possibly prolonging survival. A multi-disciplinary approach is vital in patients with advanced oesophageal cancer."
Do organ system failures predict prognosis in critically ill patients with acute renal failure requiring dialysis?,The mortality rate for intensive care unit patients with acute renal failure continues to be high. Multiple organ system failure occurs frequently and is the major cause of death. The mortality rate increases as the number of failed organs increases.
Does newborn circumcision decrease incidence and costs of urinary tract infections during the first year of life?,"Newborn circumcision results in a 9. 1-fold decrease in incidence of UTI during the first year of life as well as markedly lower UTI-related medical costs and rate of hospital admissions. Newborn circumcision during the first year of life is, thus, a valuable preventive health measure, particularly in the first 3 months of life, when uncircumcised males are most likely to be hospitalized with severe UTI."
Are adenoma size and number predictive of adenoma recurrence : implications for surveillance colonoscopy?,Patients with 1 or 2 adenomas all measuring less than 1 cm are an identified low risk group and their first surveillance examination may be delayed beyond the standard 3 years.
Do cocaine abusers show a blunted response to alcohol intoxication in limbic brain regions?,The blunted response to alcohol in cocaine abusers contrasts with their enhanced sensitivity to benzodiazepines suggesting that targets other than GABA-benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the blunted sensitivity to alcohol and that the toxicity from combined cocaine-alcohol use is not due to an enhanced sensitivity to alcohol in cocaine abusers. The blunted response to alcohol in limbic regions and in cortical regions connected to limbic areas could result from a decreased sensitivity of reward circuits in cocaine abusers.
Does bladder stretch alter urinary heparin-binding epidermal growth factor and antiproliferative factor in patients with interstitial cystitis?,Bladder stretch increased HB-EGF and conversely reduced antiproliferative factor activity in urine from patients with interstitial cystitis but not controls up to 2 weeks after distention. These results provide additional evidence for the possible role of antiproliferative factor and decreased HB-EGF in the pathophysiology of interstitial cystitis. To our knowledge this is also the first human study to show that in vivo bladder stretch can alter urinary factors that regulate cell growth.
Is aPOE-epsilon4 associated with memory decline in cognitively impaired elderly?,"APOE-epsilon4 was associated with memory decline in subjects with cognitive impairment, but not in normally functioning subjects. Contrary to AD studies, our study suggests that the risk of APOE-epsilon4 on memory decline does not decrease at higher ages."
Does slow N-acetyltransferase 2 genotype affect the incidence of isoniazid and rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity?,Slow NAT2* genotype significantly affected the development of INH + RMP-induced hepatotoxicity. This suggests the possibility that NAT2* genotyping prior to medication may be useful in evaluating patients with high risk for INH + RMP-induced hepatotoxicity.
Does tumor necrosis factor-alpha induce apoptosis via inducible nitric oxide synthase in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes?,TNF alpha induces apoptosis via iNOS expression and NO production in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes.
Is a genetic variation in the 5 ' flanking region of the UCP3 gene associated with body mass index in humans in interaction with physical activity?,The C-->T polymorphism in the 5' sequences of the UCP3 gene might contribute to the corpulence in obese and normal weight subjects and alter the benefit of physical activity. The UCP3 gene can be considered as a gene modifying corpulence.
Are maternal serum levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor associated with adverse pregnancy outcome?,This study suggests that absolute levels and relative changes in maternal serum M-CSF levels during pregnancy are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Are cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis : K-ras mutations and Tp53 dysfunction implicated in the neoplastic development?,We conclude that K-ras mutations and p53 dysfunction are implicated in tumorigenesis of cholangiocarcinomas arising in PSC patients and that these abnormalities together with increased Ki-67 index may indicate neoplastic progression of bile ducts in these patients.
Do line bisection judgments implicate right parietal cortex and cerebellum as assessed by fMRI?,"The right hemispheric dominance observed in inferior parietal cortex is consistent with the results of lesion studies. Right superior parietal cortex, vermis, and left cerebellar hemisphere have not been implicated in neglect, but all appear to play a cognitive role in the Landmark task."
Does modulation of single motor unit discharge using magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in incomplete spinal cord injury?,"Increased thresholds and latencies of excitation and inhibition may reflect degraded corticospinal transmission in the spinal cord. However, the relatively greater increase in the latency of inhibition compared with excitation in the patients with iSCI may reflect a weak or absent early component of cortical inhibition. Such a change in cortical inhibition may relate to the restoration of useful motor function after iSCI."
Do the cost of burn care and implications for efficient care?,"Acute burn care is a costly service. The goal of burn care should shift from saving lives to allowing for a productive return to society. Quality improvement, outcome measurement, and technology assessment combined with health economics research for burn care should be carried out in Japan."
Does angiotensin II receptor blockade attenuate the deleterious effects of exercise training on post-MI ventricular remodelling in rats?,"Following large anterior MI, losartan attenuated LV dilation and scar thinning. In untreated animals, exercise decreased dilation, but also contributed to scar thinning. Therefore, exercise concurrent with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may provide optimal therapeutic benefit following large anterior MI."
Is loss of CO2 reactivity of cerebral blood flow associated with severe brain damage in mechanically ventilated very low birth weight infants?,In mechanically ventilated very low birthweight infants low CO2 reactivity of cerebral blood flow (below 10%/kPa CO2) during the first 36 hours of life was associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcome or hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy at autopsy. Loss of CO2 reactivity may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. It is a candidate for predicting early severe brain damage in preterm infants requiring intensive care and for controlling the effect of early interventions.
Does the distinct HERG missense mutation L564P cause long QT syndrome in one French Canadian family?,This electrophysiological study suggests that coexpression of HERG wild type and mutant L564P results in a dominant negative effect of the mutation.
Is cyclin D1 expression predictive of occult metastases in head and neck cancer patients with clinically negative cervical lymph nodes?,"Our study indicates that the expression of cyclin D1 correlates with the presence of occult cervical metastases in head and neck carcinoma patients, thus suggesting that its immunohistochemical evaluation in biopsy samples may be used as an additional tool for identifying patients to be treated with elective neck dissection."
Do new Q waves on the presenting electrocardiogram independently predict increased cardiac mortality following a first ST-elevation myocardial infarction?,New Q waves at presentation are independently associated with a worse outcome after a first myocardial infarction. The presence of new Q waves on the presenting electrocardiogram allows very early identification of patients at risk of increased cardiac mortality.
Is the GH response to low-dose bolus growth hormone-releasing hormone ( GHRH ( 1-29 ) NH2 ) attenuated in patients with longstanding post-irradiation GH insufficiency?,The GH response to bolus GHRH(1-29)NH(2) is attenuated in adult long-term survivors of childhood brain tumours. This may reflect direct pituitary damage and/or the loss of the tropic effects of chronic GHRH deficiency.
Does eEG predict surgical outcome in lesional frontal lobe epilepsy?,"The absence of generalized EEG signs is the most predictive variable for a seizure-free outcome in FLE surgery. Furthermore, nonlesional MRI, somatosensory aura, and secondarily generalized seizures are risk factors for poor surgical results."
Is [ The common C677T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene associated with neural tube defects and preeclampsia ]?,The authors believe that MTHFR VV genotype is associated with the development of NTDs and preeclampsia.
Is allogeneic red blood cell transfusion an independent risk factor for the development of postoperative bacterial infection?,These data support the hypothesis that allogeneic red cell transfusion is an independent risk factor for the development of postoperative bacterial infection in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. This association provides further reason to minimise exposure to allogeneic transfusions in the perioperative setting.
Is nonadherence with ambulatory saliva sampling associated with biased salivary testosterone estimates?,"The results suggest that common ambulatory nonadherence with scheduled saliva sampling is associated with biased salivary testosterone estimates. They will inform further studies estimating salivary testosterone with ambulatory saliva-sampling designs and highlight the relevance of strategies to improve or confirm adherence, beyond routinely used instructions."
Does neutralization of vascular endothelial growth factor slow progression of retinal nonperfusion in patients with diabetic macular edema?,"Just as high VEGF levels contribute to progression of retinal nonperfusion in retinal vein occlusion, the same is true in patients with DME, suggesting that regardless of the underlying disease process, high levels of VEGF can cause closure of retinal vessels. However, our data also suggest that VEGF-induced worsening of retinal perfusion in DME is superimposed on another cause of more gradually worsening perfusion, possibly glucotoxicity. Thus, monthly injections of ranibizumab can slow, but not completely prevent, retinal capillary closure in patients with DME."
Does alcohol withdrawal alleviate adipose tissue inflammation in patients with alcoholic liver disease?,"In alcoholic patients, upregulation of chemotactic factors in the liver and SAT is an early event that begins as early as the steatosis stage. The inflammasome pathway is upregulated in the liver of patients with ALD. One week of alcohol withdrawal alleviates macrophage infiltration in SAT and orients ATM towards a M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype; this implicates alcohol in adipose tissue inflammation (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00388323)."
Does use of prototype two-channel endoscope with elevator enable larger lift-and-snare endoscopic mucosal resection in a porcine model?,"The increased lift of the mucosal epithelium, through use of the dual-channel elevator scope, allows for larger EMR when using a lift-grasp-cut technique. Noting the thin nature of the porcine colonic wall, use of the elevator may also make this technique safer."
Does btk inhibition suppress agonist-induced human macrophage activation and inflammatory gene expression in RA synovial tissue explants?,"Btk is expressed equivalently in RA and PsA synovial tissue, primarily in macrophages. Btk activity is needed to drive macrophage activation in response to multiple agonists relevant to inflammatory arthritis, and promotes RA synovial tissue cytokine and MMP production. Pharmacological targeting of Btk may be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of RA and other inflammatory diseases."
Does isoflurane impair learning and hippocampal long-term potentiation via the saturation of synaptic plasticity?,Isoflurane impairs hippocampal learning and modulates synaptic plasticity in the postanesthetic period. Increased GluA1 may reduce synaptic capacity for additional GluA1-containing AMPARs trafficking.
Is a prior diagnosis of breast cancer a risk factor for breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers?,"In a woman with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation who is diagnosed with breast cancer, the risk of cancer in the contralateral breast depends on the first diagnosis. That observation supports the hypothesis that there are important genetic or non-genetic modifiers of cancer risk in BRCA carriers. Discovering risk modifiers might lead to greater personalization of risk assessment and management recommendations for BRCA-positive patients."
Does combined elevation of microRNA-196a and microRNA-196b in sera predict unfavorable prognosis in patients with osteosarcomas?,"Our present data indicate the involvement of miR-196a and miR-196b upregulation in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. More importantly, the altered levels of circulating miR-196a and miR-196b might have great potential to serve as novel and non-invasive prognostic factors for this malignancy."
Does assessment of procedural skills using virtual simulation remain a challenge?,"Only the full procedure of the LAP Mentor procedural simulator has enough discriminative power to claim construct validity. However, the lack of quality control, which is indispensible in the evaluation of procedural skills, makes it currently unsuited for the assessment of procedural laparoscopic skills. The role of the simulator in a training context remains to be elucidated."
Is nOX2-generated oxidative stress associated with severity of ultrasound liver steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?,"We demonstrated increased markers of oxidative stress in subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver. Urinary 8-iso-PGF2α and serum soluble NOX2-derived peptide levels were independent from obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome and increased with the severity of liver steatosis at ultrasound."
Is preeclampsia in high risk women characterized by risk group-specific abnormalities in serum biomarkers?,Patterns of serum biomarkers vary by high-risk group. These data support the hypothesis that multiple pathogenic pathways lead to the disease recognized clinically as preeclampsia.
Does mALDI imaging on tissue microarrays identify molecular features associated with renal cell cancer phenotype?,Our data pinpoint towards various molecules with potential relevance in renal cell cancer. They also demonstrate that the combination of the MALDI mass spectrometry imaging and large-scale tissue microarray platforms represents a powerful approach to identify clinically-relevant molecular cancer features.
Does long noncoding RNA related to cartilage injury promote chondrocyte extracellular matrix degradation in osteoarthritis?,The results indicate that lncRNA-CIR contributes to ECM degradation and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of OA. We propose that lncRNA-CIR could be used as a potential target in OA therapy.
Does provider awareness alone improve transition readiness skills in adolescent patients with inflammatory bowel disease?,Increasing awareness around transition readiness for pediatric providers had an insignificant effect on the self-management skills of patients with IBD. A more formal or structured approach is likely required to improve transition skills in adolescent patients.
Is time-domain T-wave alternans strongly associated with a history of ventricular fibrillation in patients with Brugada syndrome?,Elevated time-domain TWA on AECG confirms arrhythmia risk in symptomatic BrS patients without the need for provocative stimuli.
Does analytical function for beta and gamma absorbed fractions of iodine-131 in spherical and ellipsoidal volumes?,"The analytical functions that we obtained from fitting process in Monte Carlo data can be used for obtaining the absorbed fractions of iodine-131 beta and gamma rays for any volume of the thyroid lobe. Moreover, our results for the spheres are in good agreement with the results of MIRD and other scientific literatures."
Are subnormal levels of vitamin D associated with acute wheeze in young children?,Our findings support the hypothesis that subnormal levels of vitamin D are associated with acute wheeze in young children.
Do ulcerative and nonulcerative forms of bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis differ in symptom intensity or response to onabotulinum toxin A?,"In this cohort, Ulc and NUlc patients had similar symptoms at baseline and comparable clinical response to intratrigonal OnabotA. These findings suggest that pain may not be directly related with ulcers themselves."
Does rNA sequencing identify novel markers of non-small cell lung cancer?,CBX3 and CRABP2 expression was markedly increased in lung cancer tissues and especially CRABP2 may be promising candidate genes in lung adenocarcinoma.
Is hepatic encephalopathy associated with slowed and delayed stimulus-associated somatosensory alpha activity?,The present results provide the first evidence for a slowing of oscillatory activity in the somatosensory system in HE in combination with a previously unknown deficit of S1 in adjusting activation levels back to baseline.
Is hER-2 expression prognostic in osteosarcoma ; a Children 's Oncology Group prospective biology study?,HER-2 expression is not prognostic in osteosarcoma in the context of this large prospective study. HER-2 expression cannot be used as a basis for stratification of therapy. Identification of potential prognostic factors should occur in the context of large multi-institutional biology studies.
Does microRNA-181a promote tumor growth and liver metastasis in colorectal cancer by targeting the tumor suppressor WIF-1?,"Our data demonstrate that miR-181a expression is associated with CRC liver metastasis and survival. miR-181a has strong tumor-promoting effects through inhibiting the expression of WIF-1, and its potential role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition."
Does inhibition during early adolescence predict alcohol and marijuana use by late adolescence?,"Compromised inhibitory functioning during early adolescence prior to the onset of substance use was related to more frequent and intense alcohol and marijuana use by late adolescence. Inhibition performance could help identify teens at risk for initiating heavy substance use during adolescence, and potentially could be modified to improve outcome."
Does miRNA-26b inhibit cellular proliferation by targeting CDK8 in breast cancer?,These findings suggest that miR-26b exerts a tumor suppressive role in breast cancer and the miR-26b-mediated growth inhibition is achieved through suppression of a new target gene CDK8.
Are anticytomegalovirus antibody titres associated with caregiving burden in younger caregivers?,"These data suggest that in the absence of immunosenescence, the chronic stress of caregiving is not sufficient to compromise the immune response to persistent CMV infection. However, an indirect mechanism to poorer health in caregivers might be via adoption of disadvantageous health behaviours in response to stress. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Older caregivers of spouses with dementia show a poorer immune response against latent viruses when compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Younger parental caregivers of children with developmental disabilities show a poorer antibody response to vaccination. What does this study add? The study showed no association between caregiving stress and CMV antibody titre in young caregivers. There were higher CMV antibody titres in the caregivers who engage in unhealthy behaviours."
Is maternal sleep duration and complaints of vital exhaustion during pregnancy associated with placental abruption?,We extend the existing literature and support the thesis that maternal sleep habits and disorders should be assessed among pregnant women.
Is endocan useful biomarker of survival and severity in sepsis?,"Results of our study show that endocan can be used as strong and significant predictor of sepsis severity and outcome, perhaps even better than SOFA and APACHE II scores."
Do intraoperative measurement for a new transcutaneous bone conduction hearing implant?,The usage of an intraoperative RTF measurement may be a good method to verify the mechanical coupling of the bone conduction floating mass transducer and to test the functional integrity of the implant in an objective way.
Do augmentative therapies potentiate the antidepressant-like effects of deep brain stimulation in rats?,"Despite having good predictive validity, animal models are limited from a translational perspective."
Does both body weight and BMI predict improvement in symptom and functioning for patients with major depressive disorder?,This is a short-term trial with relatively small sample size.
Do brainstem infarcts predict REM sleep behavior disorder in acute ischemic stroke?,The results support the notion of a predominant role of brainstem injury in the development of RBD and suggest that patients with brainstem infarcts RBD should be evaluated by a clinical neurologist.
Does collaborative DTM reduce hospitalization and healthcare costs in patients with diabetes treated with polypharmacy?,A collaborative pharmacist-driven DTM program with a care manager-executed patient outreach component results in reduced hospital utilization and significant healthcare cost savings.
Are genetic variants in microRNA machinery genes associated [ corrected ] with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss risk?,Our study demonstrates the relationship between RPL development and the polymorphism of the miRNA machinery gene RAN and combined genotype of DROSHA/DICER.
Is severe malarial anemia associated with long-term neurocognitive impairment?,"In children <5 years of age, SMA is associated with long-term impairment in cognitive ability, whereas CM is associated with additional impairment in the areas of attention and associative memory. SMA may be a major contributor to long-term neurocognitive impairment in children in sub-Saharan Africa."
Do neural responses to exclusion predict susceptibility to social influence?,"These results address the neural bases of social influence and risk taking; contribute to our understanding of social and emotional function in the adolescent brain; and link neural activity in specific, hypothesized, regions to risk-relevant outcomes beyond the neuroimaging laboratory. Results of this investigation are discussed in terms of the mechanisms underlying risk taking in adolescents and the public health implications for adolescent driving."

Do dopamine transporters in striatum correlate with deactivation in the default mode network during visuospatial attention?,These findings provide evidence that dopamine transporters modulate neural activity in the DMN and anterior cingulate gyrus during visuospatial attention. Our findings suggest that dopamine modulates attention in part by regulating neuronal activity in posterior parietal cortex including precuneus (region involved in alertness) and cingulate gyrus (region deactivated in proportion to emotional interference). These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of stimulant medications (increase dopamine by blocking DAT) in inattention reflect in part their ability to facilitate the deactivation of the DMN.
Does expression of p-AKT characterize adenoid cystic carcinomas of head and neck with a higher risk for tumor relapses?,"Adenoid cystic carcinomas positive for p-AKT show a higher relapse risk. However, other parameters of glucose metabolism investigated here or proliferation (Ki67) were not predictive in this entity.

This added value of 3D MPR was most important in extensive and/or commissural prolapse.
Does it 's all about recognition ! Qualitative study of the value of interpersonal continuity in general practice?,"It was not valuable to have a continuous relationship unless the GP recognized the patient. The social psychological concept of recognition had two different meanings and the GP had to do both, respect and remember the patient, in order to create and sustain the trustful relationship. The added value of interpersonal continuity had to be combined with recognition."
Does common sequence variation in the VEGFA gene predict risk of diabetic retinopathy?,Sequence variation in the VEGFA gene is associated with risk of developing blinding DR in T1DM and T2DM.

Early recognition of NAFLD by radiological imaging tests in this group of young patients is warranted."
Does platelet-derived growth factor expression correlate with tumor grade and proliferative activity in human oligodendrogliomas?,"The results of this study showed that MIB-1 LI is a rapid and cost-effective modality for predicting tumor grade in oligodendrogliomas. Immunohistochemistry for PDGF was found to be useful in differentiating various grades of oligodendroglioma, and therefore, it may be involved in tumor cell proliferation and malignant transformation. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, although expressed in oligodendroglial neoplasms, was not found to be useful in predicting tumor grade."

The non-significant changes in the expression of main epigenetic modifiers in SHS-exposed mice imply that SHS may predominantly induce genotoxic effects, particularly at non-tumorigenic doses, whereas epigenetic effects may only be secondary and manifest en route to tumor formation."
Is mortality in patients with non-functioning pituitary adenoma increased : systematic analysis of 546 cases with long follow-up?,"Despite the improvement of treatments over the last three decades, the mortality of patients with NFAs in our series remains high. Apart from age, factors related with the management/outcome of the tumor are not independent predictors, and pituitary hormone deficits managed with the currently-used substitution protocols do not adversely affect mortality."
Does combination of Photodynamic Therapy and Specific Immunotherapy Efficiently eradicate Established Tumors?,"We show that immunotherapy can be efficiently combined with PDT to eradicate established tumors, based on strong local tumor ablation and the induction of a robust systemic immune response. These results suggest combination of active immunotherapy with tumor ablation by PDT as a feasible novel treatment strategy for advanced cancer."

Is informed consent instead of assent appropriate in children from the age of twelve : Policy implications of new findings on children 's competence to consent to clinical research?,"Although assessment of children's competence has a normative character, ethics, law and clinical practice can benefit from research data. The findings may help to do justice to the capacities children possess and challenges they may face when deciding about treatment and research options. We discuss advantages and drawbacks of standardized competence assessment in children on a case-by-case basis compared to application of a fixed age limit, and conclude that a selective implementation of case-by-case competence assessment in specific populations is preferable. We recommend the implementation of age limits based on empirical evidence. Furthermore, we elaborate on a suitable model for informed consent involving children and parents that would do justice to developmental aspects of children and the specific characteristics of the parent-child dyad. Previous research outcomes showed that children's medical decision-making capacities could be operationalized into a standardized assessment instrument. Recommendations for policies include a dual consent procedure, including both child as well as parents, for children from the age of 12 until they reach majority. For children between 10 and 12 years of age, and in case of children older than 12 years in special research populations of mentally compromised patients, we suggest a case-by-case assessment of children's competence to consent. Since such a dual consent procedure is fundamentally different from a procedure of parental permission and child assent, and would imply a considerable shift regarding some current legislations, practical implications are elaborated."
Is anticholinergic burden associated with recurrent and injurious falls in older individuals?,"The association between recurrent and injurious falls and the use of any medications listed in the ACB scale was mediated through gait and balance impairment but not by muscular weakness, providing a novel insight into the potential mechanistic link between ACB and falls. Future studies should determine whether TUG and FR measurements could help inform risk to benefit decisions where ACB medications are being considered."

Are cortical Lewy bodies and Aβ burden associated with prevalence and timing of dementia in Lewy body diseases?,"High CLB burden is a key neuropathological substrate of dementia in LBD. Elevated cortical LB pathology and Aβ plaque deposition are both correlated with a faster progression to dementia. The higher CLB load in the temporal and parietal regions, which seems to be a distinguishing feature of DLB, may account for the shorter latency to dementia and could be mediated by the APOE ϵ4 allele."
Does prenatal cigarette smoke exposure attenuate recovery from hypoxemic challenge in preterm infants?,We provide evidence of how prenatal CS exposure and hypoxemic episodes affect the duration and recovery of breathing pauses in preterm infants. These observations could help explain why these infants are at a particularly high risk for sudden infant death syndrome.

Is local body composition associated with gender differences of bone development at the forearm in puberty?,"Modeling and bone strength were primarily predicted by MA. Markers of remodeling were positively correlated with FA in pubertal females, but not in prepubertal individuals and pubertal males. Therefore, gender and puberty modify the relationship between FA and bone development."
Does dihydrotestosterone inhibit murine hair growth via the androgen receptor?,"Androgens inhibit hair growth in mice, and this inhibition might be caused by androgen-androgen receptor signals."
Does a novel mutation confirm MFRP as the gene causing the syndrome of nanophthalmos-renititis pigmentosa-foveoschisis-optic disk drusen?,"We confirmed that the syndrome of posterior microphthalmos, retinitis pigmentosa, foveoschisis, and optic disk drusen constitutes a distinct autosomal recessive entity. The novel frameshift mutation identified in the family described here validates MFRP as the gene responsible for this particular disease, which characteristically involves structures located at the posterior segment of the eye."
Does removal of all radioactive sentinel nodes in breast cancer improve the detection of positive sentinel nodes?,"Lymphoscintigraphy does not accurately predict the number of SLNs identified intraoperatively, this number being underestimated. Surgeons should remove all radioactive SLNs to improve the detection of positive SLNs."
Does gait analysis correlate with clinical and MR imaging parameters in patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis?,"According to the results of this study MRI findings failed to show a major clinical relevance when evaluating the walking distance in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and, therefore, should be treated with some caution as a predictor of walking distance. In determining the disease pattern of spinal stenosis functional back capacity and BMI might play a more active role than previously thought."
Does power quality affect teacher wellbeing and student behavior in three Minnesota Schools?,"Dirty electricity in schools may be adversely affecting wellbeing of teachers and behavior of their students, especially younger students in middle and elementary school. Power line filters improve power quality and may also protect those who are sensitive to this energy. Work on electric and magnetic field metrics with and without Stetzer filters urgently needs to be carried out to determine just what characteristics of the dirty electricity may be interacting with the people."
"Is the pituitary-adrenal axis activated more in non-survivors than in survivors of cardiac arrest , irrespective of therapeutic hypothermia?","In comatose patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, the pituitary-adrenal axis is activated particularly in those dying in the ICU, irrespective of therapeutic hypothermia. Hence, activation of the axis may be a marker of fatal cerebral damage. There is no firm evidence for relative adrenal insufficiency associated with death and a transiently blunted cortisol response to ACTH in non-survivors may be attributed to higher baseline values."
Is symmetric dimethylarginine an independent predictor of intradialytic hypotension?,"Increased pre-HD SDMA plasma concentrations and greater SDMA reductions during HD independently predict IDH after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables, pre-HD SBP, and other methylated forms of L-arginine."
Does intra-amygdaloid infusion of Ginkgo biloba leaf extract ( EGb761 ) facilitate fear-potentiated startle in rats?,"These results suggested that a single dose of EGb761 also has memory-enhancing effects in young animals. In addition, BLA is the central locus for EGb761 facilitation effect on FPS."
Does proteomic analysis of ovarian cancer cells reveal dynamic processes of protein secretion and shedding of extra-cellular domains?,"Protein profiles of the cell lines had substantial similarity to the profiles of human ovarian cancer cells from ascites fluid and included protein markers known to be associated with ovarian cancer. Proteomic analysis indicated extensive shedding from extra-cellular domains of proteins expressed on the cell surface, and remarkably high secretion rates for some proteins (nanograms per million cells per hour). Cell surface and secreted proteins identified by in-depth proteomic profiling of ovarian cancer cells may provide new targets for diagnosis and therapy."
Is retinal nerve fiber layer atrophy associated with physical and cognitive disability in multiple sclerosis?,"In summary, both OCT and HRT are able to detect thinning of the RNFL, but OCT seems to be the most sensitive technique to identify changes associated with MS evolution."
Is pRNP 1368 polymorphism associated with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the Korean population?,"A significant difference of genotype and allele frequencies at PRNP 1368 was found between the normal Korean population and various European populations. In contrast to the results in the British and German populations, our study does not show a significant difference in genotype (P = 0.2763) and allele (P = 0.3750) frequencies of PRNP 1368 between sporadic CJD and normal controls."

Is pSA velocity associated with gleason score in radical prostatectomy specimen : marker for prostate cancer aggressiveness?,"Our results have further validated PSAV as a marker for prostate cancer aggressiveness. The preoperative PSAV was a significant independent predictor of the Gleason score and non-organ-confined disease in the radical prostatectomy specimen. Thus, PSAV could be useful in treatment decision-making and in assessing the likelihood of long-term cancer control in men with prostate cancer."
Does atomoxetine reverse attentional deficits produced by noradrenergic deafferentation of medial prefrontal cortex?,"Though atomoxetine is neurochemically selective, it is not wholly specific at doses >0.3 mg/kg. All doses of the drug were similar in their efficacy in reversing the ED deficit, but the effectiveness of the 0.1 mg/kg dose supports the hypothesis that increases in prefrontal NE alone are sufficient to improve attention in NE-LX rats. Moreover, the detrimental effects of the drug in non-lesioned rats support the hypothesis that optimal levels of NE in prefrontal cortex are critical to attentional set shifting with both supra- and sub-optimal levels producing attentional impairments."
Does a brief prehospital stroke severity scale identify ischemic stroke patients harboring persisting large arterial occlusions?,Stroke severity assessed by the LAMS predicts presence of large artery anterior circulation occlusion with high sensitivity and specificity.

Does late gadolinium enhancement by cardiovascular magnetic resonance herald an adverse prognosis in nonischemic cardiomyopathy?,"A CMR LGE in NICM patients strongly predicts adverse cardiac outcomes. The CMR LGE may represent the end-organ consequences of sustained adrenergic activation and adverse LV remodeling, and its identification may significantly improve risk stratification strategies in this high risk population. (Imaging Techniques for Identifying Factors of Sudden Cardiac Death Risk; NCT00181233)."
Is a polymorphism of EGFR extracellular domain associated with progression free-survival in metastatic colorectal cancer patients receiving cetuximab-based treatment?,"This preliminary study suggests that: an increase in EGFR copy number may be associated with cetuximab response but is a rare event in CRC, KRAS mutations are associated with low response rate but do not preclude any cetuximab-based combination efficacy and EGFR exon 13 variant (R521K) may predict for cetuximab benefit."
Are red-blood-cell to plasma ratios transfused during massive transfusion associated with mortality in severe multiple injury : a retrospective analysis from the Trauma Registry of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Unfallchirurgie?,An association between pRBC : FFP transfusion ratios and mortality to favour early aggressive FFP administration was observed.

A case-control study?,"Exercising regularly protects from physical functioning loss in older persons and against a decrease in voluntary step execution times during single-task but not during dual-task conditions. Lack of specificity (dual-task exercises) during the training may be the cause of insignificant differences in dual-task stepping performance. Thus, adding dual-task training may improve dual-task performance in the elderly."
"Does gabapentin reduce post-thoracotomy shoulder pain : a randomized , double-blind placebo-controlled study?","Pre-emptively administered gabapentin, 1200 mg, does not reduce the incidence, or the severity, of post-thoracotomy shoulder pain in patients receiving thoracic epidural analgesia."
Does thoracic epidural analgesia improve pulmonary function in patients undergoing cardiac surgery?,High TEA decreases postoperative pain and atelectasis and improves pulmonary function in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Our results support the use of TEA in this group of patients.

Does comparison of auditory brainstem response result in normal-hearing patients with and without tinnitus?,"We conclude that, although the averages obtained in several analyzed parameters were within normal limits, the ABR results from the patients with and without tinnitus and normal hearing are different, suggesting that ABR might contribute to the workup of these patients. Our data show that there are changes in the central pathways in the study group. The meaning of these changes must be further investigated."
Do personality and choice of coping predict quality of life in head and neck cancer patients during follow-up?,"In conclusion, a high T stage, high neuroticism, coping by humor and coping by problem solving directly predicted low QoL whereas neuroticism was also associated with QoL through avoidance coping."
Are plasmodium vivax and mixed infections associated with severe malaria in children : a prospective cohort study from Papua New Guinea?,"P. vivax monoinfections as well as mixed Plasmodium infections are associated with SM. There is no indication that mixed infections protected against SM. Interventions targeted toward P. falciparum only might be insufficient to eliminate the overall malaria burden, and especially severe disease, in areas where P. falciparum and P. vivax coexist."
Does an endocannabinoid signaling system modulate anxiety-like behavior in male Syrian hamsters?,Endocannabinoids engage functional CB1 receptors in hamster brain to suppress anxiety-like behavior and undergo enzymatic hydrolysis catalyzed by FAAH. Our results further suggest that neither unconditioned nor conditioned social defeat in the Syrian hamster is dependent upon cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation.
Does corticosteroid therapy increase membrane-tethered while decreases secreted mucin expression in nasal polyps?,"These results suggest: (i) CS up-regulate membrane (MUC1, MUC4) while down-regulate secreted (MUC5AC, MUC5B) mucins; (ii) there exists a link between secreted mucin expression and goblet cell hyperplasia; and (iii) NP from AIA may develop resistance to CS treatment."

The results from the present study should foster further investigation of treatments using an inhibitor for the CCR7 protein to improve the survival of pancreatic cancer.
Does cellular islet autoimmunity associate with clinical outcome of islet cell transplantation?,"In this cohort study, cellular islet-specific autoimmunity associates with clinical outcome of islet cell transplantation under ATG-tacrolimus-MMF immunosuppression. Tailored immunotherapy targeting cellular islet autoreactivity may be required. Monitoring cellular immune reactivity can be useful to identify factors influencing graft survival and to assess efficacy of immunosuppression."
Does whole genome assessment of the retinal response to diabetes reveal a progressive neurovascular inflammatory response?,"These changes in permeability, apoptosis, and gene expression provide further evidence of progressive retinal malfunction with increasing duration of diabetes. The specific gene expression changes confirmed in multiple sets of animals indicate that pro-inflammatory, anti-vascular barrier, and neurodegenerative changes occur in tandem with functional increases in apoptosis and vascular permeability. These responses are shared with the clinically documented inflammatory response in diabetic retinopathy suggesting that this model may be used to test anti-inflammatory therapeutics."
Does a luciferase immunoprecipitation systems assay enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of Strongyloides stercoralis infection?,LIPS addresses several limitations of current ELISAs and represents a major advance in the diagnosis of S. stercoralis infection.
Do de novo LMNA mutations cause a new form of congenital muscular dystrophy?,"The LMNA mutations identified appear to correlate with a relatively severe phenotype. Our results further broaden the spectrum of laminopathies and define a new disease entity that we suggest is best classified as a congenital muscular dystrophy (LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy, or L-CMD)."
Is uVA1 phototherapy effective in darker skin : a review of 101 patients of Fitzpatrick skin types I-V?,"Data indicate skin pigmentation as graded by Fitzpatrick skin type does not significantly influence the efficacy of UVA1 phototherapy. Thus, UVA1 should be considered as a therapeutic option in more darkly pigmented patients."
Is husbands ' SUD associated with higher levels of co-occurring but not non-co-occurring psychiatric disorders among their wives?,"These findings demonstrate that SUD and co-occurring psychiatric disorders (with SUD) are more common among the spouses of SUD+ husbands than among the spouses of SUD- husbands, but non-co-occurring (""pure"") psychiatric disorders are not more common among the spouses of the SUD+ husbands."
Do submucosal uterine leiomyomas have a global effect on molecular determinants of endometrial receptivity?,"The molecular mechanism by which submucosal myomas adversely affect reproduction includes a global decrease in endometrial HOX gene expression, not simply a focal change over the myoma. This may explain the reproductive dysfunction observed with submucosal myomas."
Is sperm head morphology related to high deoxyribonucleic acid stainability assessed by sperm chromatin structure assay?,"The observed relationship between sperm head defects and %HDS suggests that sperm head abnormalities may, in part, be due to incomplete sperm chromatin condensation."
Does eUS accurately predict the need for therapeutic ERCP in patients with a low probability of biliary obstruction?,Single-center experience.
Is overweight associated with decreased cognitive functioning among school-age children and adolescents?,"Increased body weight is independently associated with decreased visuospatial organization and general mental ability among children.

Does a pacifier increase the risk of recurrent acute otitis media in children in day care centers?,"We conclude that the use of a pacifier is a significant risk factor for recurrent AOM and suggest that pacifiers should be used only during the first 10 months of life, when need for sucking is strongest, and AOM is uncommon."
Do signs of defensive control locate conflicted topics in discourse?,The findings support the psychodynamic hypothesis that observation of defensive behaviors may locate times of communication about conflicted themes.
Does nonocclusive common carotid artery thrombosis in the rat result in reversible sensorimotor and cognitive behavioral deficits?,"CCAT produces consistent sensorimotor and cognitive behavioral deficits that recover within 2 weeks of injury. Behavioral outcome was not necessarily associated with overt histopathological damage, suggesting that reversible injury mechanisms, both vascular and neuronal, may be partly responsible for the temporary loss of function. These data strengthen the role of CCAT as a clinically relevant model of thromboembolic stroke."
Do survival in major burn injuries is predicted by early response to Swan-Ganz-guided resuscitation?,Unsustained or inadequate response to hyperdynamic resuscitation of burns was associated with nonsurvival.
Does severe acidosis alone predict mortality in the trauma patient?,"Severe acidosis alone is not a sufficiently powerful predictor of outcome to justify withholding resuscitation; however, when combined with coma and shock, this condition had no survivors in this small series."
Does age correlate with increased frequency of high risk factors in elderly patients with thyroid cancer?,The prognostic importance of age in thyroid cancer may be due to the greater prevalence of pathologic risk factors in older patients.
Does cluster analysis of Helicobacter pylori genomic DNA fingerprints suggest gastroduodenal disease-specific associations?,"Cluster analysis of REP-PCR DNA fingerprints of H. pylori strains suggests that duodenal ulcer isolates, as a group, are more similar to one another and different from gastritis isolates. These results suggest that disease-specific strains may exist."
Do physicians ' psychosocial beliefs correlate with their patient communication skills?,"Physician beliefs about psychosocial aspects of patient care are associated with their communication with patients in routine office visits. Patients of physicians with more positive attitudes have more psychosocial discussions in visits than do patients of physicians with less positive attitudes. They also appear more involved as partners in their care. These findings have implications for medical educators, teachers, and practicing physicians."
Is microsatellite instability in human colonic cancer a useful clinical indicator of familial colorectal cancer?,"Although some very small, and as yet undefined, proportion of colon cancer may be caused by inherited mutations leading to microsatellite instability, tumoral instability by itself is not a marker for familiality and should not be considered as evidence for an inherited syndrome."
Is high density lipoprotein cholesterol associated with serum cortisol in older people?,Endogenous glucocorticoid levels correlated with HDL cholesterol levels and may play a role in the physiologic regulation of high density lipoprotein levels in older people.
Do women 's reports of breast implant problems and silicone-related illness?,"Findings included dissatisfaction with implants, similarity of health problems, and recurrent surgical and nonsurgical procedures. Dominant themes included lack of informed consent, physician denial of health problems, and the decision to remove implants. Further research should be directed at recipients of implants who report silicone-related illness to determine the number of women affected and the nature of their problems."
Does acute spermatic cord torsion alter the microcirculation of the contralateral testis?,"Acute spermatic cord torsion altered the microcirculation by increasing the amplitude of vasomotion and decreased total blood flow to the opposite testis. Because the hydraulic resistance of a blood vessel exhibiting vasomotion is always less than a vessel with the same average but static diameter, the observed microcirculatory changes may be an adaptive response to preserve local flow in the presence of decreased total flow. The long-term consequences of these changes in the microcirculation may affect testicular function and ultimately fertility."
Does dimethyl sulfoxide trigger urine histamine release in interstitial cystitis?,The relief of symptoms reported in 50% to 77% of patients treated with intravesical DMSO is not related to detectable mast cell release of histamine. Other mechanisms of action must be investigated to explain the beneficial effect of this agent.

Is contralateral duplex scanning for deep venous thrombosis unnecessary in patients with symptoms?,"Although bilateral involvement is frequent in patients with symptoms of acute DVT, treatment in these patients is not altered by this finding. We conclude that contralateral venous scanning in patients with unilateral symptoms is not clinically indicated and that unilateral scanning would result in improved cost-efficiency for vascular laboratories."
Does hyperbaric oxygen after global cerebral ischemia in rabbits reduce brain vascular permeability and blood flow?,"HBO administered after global cerebral ischemia promoted blood-brain barrier integrity. HBO treatment also reduced cerebral blood flow; this effect was not associated with a reduction in evoked potential recovery. Since neurological outcome after global cerebral ischemia is generally poor and treatment options are limited, HBO should be further investigated as a potential therapy."
Do cognitive styles and personality characteristics strongly influence the decision to have photorefractive keratectomy?,Specific cognitive styles and personality characteristics strongly influence the choice to pursue photorefractive keratectomy when that choice is not occupationally driven.
"Is except for alanine , muscle protein catabolism influenced by alterations in glucose metabolism during sepsis?","The findings of this study demonstrate a universal acceleration in the metabolic rates of both intermediary glucose metabolism and protein/amino acid catabolism during sepsis. Except for alanine, however, there appears to be no coupling between these two physiologic responses to sepsis."
Does clinical assessment identify hemodynamic profiles that predict outcomes in patients admitted with heart failure?,Simple clinical assessment can be used to define profiles in patients admitted with HF. These profiles predict outcomes and may be used to guide therapy and identify populations for future investigation.
Is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to sarcomeric gene mutations characterized by impaired energy metabolism irrespective of the degree of hypertrophy?,"Our data provide evidence of a bioenergetic deficit in genotype-confirmed HCM, which is present to a similar degree in three disease-gene groups. The presence of energetic abnormalities, even in those without hypertrophy, supports a proposed link between altered cardiac energetics and development of the disease phenotype."
Do central retinal artery Doppler flow parameters reflect the severity of cerebral small-vessel disease?,Flow parameters may be useful for the quantitative assessment of SVD severity.
Does baseline personality functioning correlate with 6 month outcome in schizophrenia?,"The better the personality functioning in schizophrenic patients the better seems to be the response to treatment, with regard to symptoms as well as rehabilitation. Personality assessment might be useful for the individualisation of therapies, even within the context of a standardised program."
"Is amyloid-beta found in drusen from some age-related macular degeneration retinas , but not in drusen from normal retinas?","Abeta was present in 4 of 9 AMD eyes. Within these eyes, Abeta localized to a subset of drusen. None of the 9 normal eyes surveyed, some of which had small drusen, were A beta positive. Abetapositive vesicles were most numerous in GA eyes at the edges of atrophy, the region at risk for further degeneration. These results suggest that Abeta in drusen correlates with the location of degenerating photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Further work will be necessary to determine whether Abeta deposition in drusen may contribute to or result from retinal degeneration."
Do simple anatomical measurements correlate significantly to individual peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds as measured in MRI gradient coils?,These results suggest it is unlikely that a simple physiologic measurement of subject anatomy can be used to guide the operation of MRI scanners in a subject-specific manner in order to increase gradient system performance while avoiding PNS.
Is long-term outcome of acute myocarditis independent of cardiac enzyme release?,"After acute myocarditis, there is late recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction, which is independent of the initial myocardial damage measured by cardiac enzyme release."
Does high dose of caffeine administered to pregnant rats cause histopathological changes in the cornea of newborn pups?,Excessive gestational caffeine intake has been shown histopathologically to have some teratogenic effects on newborn rat cornea.
Does depression influence the EDI scores in anorexia nervosa patients?,"The present results suggested that the EDI scores are clearly influenced by the severity of depression. Among the psychopathological and behavioural traits assessed with the EDI, only a few were not related to depressive symptoms: ""feeling of inefficiency"" and ""distrust in interpersonal relations""."
Do neuroblastoma cells inhibit the immunostimulatory function of dendritic cells?,These findings have significant implications for tumor-pulsed DC vaccines in the treatment of NB and suggest a mechanism by which NB escape rejection.
Does advanced neuroblastoma impair dendritic cell function in adoptive immunotherapy?,"IL-12 DC from tumor-bearing animals have a decreased ability to induce antitumor activity against established murine NB. This decreased capacity appears to be related to the duration of exposure to tumor because day 14 transduced DC had less of an effect than day 7 DC, despite similar phenotypes and ability to activate immune effector cells."
Does the dynostatic algorithm accurately calculate alveolar pressure on-line during ventilator treatment in children?,"Fibreoptic measurement of tracheal pressure in combination with the dynostatic calculation of alveolar pressure provides an on-line monitoring of the effects of ventilatory mode in terms of volume-dependent compliance, tracheal peak pressure and true positive end expiratory pressure."
Do kidneys in hypertensive rats show reduced response to nitric oxide synthase inhibition as evaluated by BOLD MRI?,"Based on the differential effect of NO synthase inhibition on medullary oxygenation, BOLD MRI can distinguish hypertensive from normal kidney. Our results are consistent with previously reported observations using invasive methods."
"Is blood transfusion , independent of shock severity , associated with worse outcome in trauma?","Blood transfusion is confirmed as an independent predictor of mortality, ICU admission, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS in trauma after controlling for severity of shock by admission base deficit, lactate, shock index, and anemia. The use of other hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying resuscitation fluids (such as human or bovine hemoglobin substitutes) in the acute postinjury period warrants further investigation."
Do plasma oxidative parameters and mortality in patients with severe burn injury?,"For the first time we demonstrate the value of oxidative parameters, namely thiobarbituric acid reactive species, protein carbonyls, and xanthine oxidase activity, in identifying burn patients with a poor prognosis. Whether these parameters are merely markers of clinical course, or whether they signal specific deleterious effects of oxidative stress during the burn injury remains to be elucidated."
Does alcohol affect executive cognitive functioning differentially on the ascending versus descending limb of the blood alcohol concentration curve?,Our results support the conclusion that alcohol negatively affects cognitive performance and has a differential effect on the descending versus the ascending limb of the blood alcohol concentration curve. The latter finding may have important ramifications relating to the detrimental consequences of alcohol intoxication.
Is serotonin transporter gene variation associated with alcohol sensitivity in rhesus macaques exposed to early-life stress?,"As in some human reports, this study demonstrates a diminution in the response to alcohol in animals homozygous for the l rh5-HTTLPR allele. The phenotypic expression of this genotype in l/s animals, however, is environmentally dependent."

Additional studies are needed to identify individuals who experience greater levels of distress following feedback in an attempt to provide improved methods of feedback and support.
Is nOTCH4 gene promoter polymorphism associated with the age of onset in schizophrenia?,"The NOTCH4 T-25C polymorphism has an important effect on the age of onset in schizophrenia and thus may be related to an early pathogenesis of schizophrenia in young patients. Alternatively, these findings may represent a significant genetic marker for managing subgroups and etiological clues in schizophrenia."
Does loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p predict neoplastic progression in Barrett 's esophagus?,Loss of heterozygosity at 17p11.1-p13 on chromosome 17p identifies patients with Barrett's esophagus at risk of neoplastic progression and can supplement histology in determining the frequency of endoscopy during surveillance.
Does cytokeratin 7 staining of hepatocytes predict progression to more severe fibrosis in alcohol-fed baboons?,"In alcohol-fed baboons, cytokeratin 7 staining of hepatocytes (but not cytokeratin 19, nor fat deposition) predicts with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity progression to more severe liver disease."
Is biliary bile acid concentration a simple and reliable indicator for liver function after hepatobiliary resection for biliary cancer?,"Biliary bile acid concentration could be a simple, real-time, reliable indicator of preoperative and postoperative liver function."
Is cerebrovascular pressure reactivity related to global cerebral oxygen metabolism after head injury?,"There is a close relation between dysautoregulation and abnormal cerebral metabolism but not blood flow. Further studies are needed to determine whether metabolic dysfunction is a result of or a cause of disturbed pressure reactivity, and to establish if there is a relation between cerebral oxygen metabolism and outcome."
Does the R271W mutant form of Pit-1 act as a dominant inhibitor of Pit-1 action to activate the promoters of GH and prolactin genes?,"Taken together with the evidence that phenotypically normal cases have been reported with this mutation, our results deny the relationship between R271W and combined pituitary hormone deficiency."
Does cardiovascular reactivity to stress predict future blood pressure in adolescence?,This study adds to the pediatric literature documenting an association between cardiovascular reactivity to stress and subsequent risk for hypertension. It is the first to show that impedance-derived measures of myocardial function during stress are related to future blood pressure levels.
Does high-resolution comparative genomic hybridisation yield a high detection rate of chromosomal aberrations in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia?,HRCGH is superior to conventional CGH as an adjunct to G-band karyotyping as it detects recurrent aberrations at a significantly higher rate than both these techniques.
Is altered response to tryptophan supplementation after long-term abstention from MDMA ( ecstasy ) highly correlated with human memory function?,Our results suggest that prolonged abstinence from MDMA might be associated with altered tryptophan metabolism. Ex-users showing the poorest memory function at baseline were also those who metabolised least tryptophan. These findings may reflect pre-morbid differences in 5-HT function of those who stop using this drug or consequences of MDMA use that emerge after abstention. Aggression is also associated with MDMA use and subsequent abstinence.
Are advanced glycation end-products pentosidine and N epsilon-carboxymethyllysine elevated in serum of patients with osteoporosis?,AGE-modified proteins may be a cause of disturbed bone remodelling in osteoporosis. Our findings do not support the alternative hypothesis that increased AGEs in serum indicate only a more intensive releasing of AGEs in circumstances of increased bone resorption.
Is an Ile93Met substitution in the UCH-L1 gene a disease-causing mutation for idiopathic Parkinson 's disease?,Our study suggested that Ile93Met of UCH-L1 gene did not influence risk of IPD.
Does mutilation anxiety differ among females with fibromyalgia and functional dyspepsia and population controls?,"Psychological state was differentiated among the three groups. Mutilation anxiety may be a psychological marker of an underlying neurobiological vulnerability for FM or may represent a secondary long-term consequence of chronic illness. In FD, death anxiety is directly related to symptom complaints, suggesting a stronger etiological association between emotions and somatic complaints in this disorder."
Is percent of prostate needle biopsy cores with cancer significant independent predictor of prostate specific antigen recurrence following radical prostatectomy : results from SEARCH database?,"Percent of positive cores in the prostate needle biopsy was a significant predictor of adverse pathology and biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy, and the cut points of less than 34%, 34% to 50% and greater than 50% can be used to risk stratify patients preoperatively. The finding that percent of positive cores from the most involved side of the biopsy was a stronger predictor of PSA failure than the total percent of cores involved suggests that multiple positive biopsies from a single side might be a better predictor of a larger total cancer volume and thus correlate with clinical outcome."
Do specific phospholipid oxidation products inhibit ligand activation of toll-like receptors 4 and 2?,"These studies report a novel mechanism that involves alterations to lipid raft/caveolar processing, by which specific phospholipid oxidation products inhibit activation by TLR4 and TLR2 ligands. These studies have broader implications for the role of ox-PAPC as a regulator of specific lipid raft/caveolar function."

Magnetic resonance imaging (FLAIR sequence) allows discrimination of different cytoarchitectonic areas of the human cerebral cortex.
Does a novel form of pontocerebellar hypoplasia map to chromosome 7q11-21?,"This pedigree represents a novel form of autosomal recessive PCH, which the authors propose to call cerebellar atrophy with progressive microcephaly (CLAM). This disorder maps to chromosome 7q11-21, and this locus was named CLAM. This report represents the first identification of a genetic locus for PCH."
Do macrophages in human reproductive tissues contain luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptors?,This is the first demonstration of macrophages present in human reproductive tissues containing LH/hCG receptors. The receptor presence suggests that LH and hCG may regulate macrophage functions in gonadal as well as in non-gonadal target tissues.
Does lazaroid attenuate edema by stabilizing ATPase in the traumatized rat brain?,"U-83836E given prophylactically after cerebral trauma appears to reduce edema, possibly by inhibiting increases in lipid peroxidation and by stabilizing ATPase. Further studies are recommended to verify the similar effects of the brain penetrating lazaroids when they are given after trauma."
Do [ The intraoperative application of neural response telemetry with the nucleus CI24M cochlear implant ]?,"The intraoperative measurements of device function and NRT are quite simple, quick and with high accuracy. Inner ear malformation is an important factor that may affect NRT results."
Are major risk factors for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in the young modifiable?,"Aneurysmal SAH may be largely a preventable disease among the young and middle-aged because several prevalent risk factors can be modified by medication (eg, hypertension) or behavioral change (eg, cigarette smoking, cocaine use). The association of caffeine and nicotine in pharmaceutical products and aneurysmal SAH warrants further study."

Do short bursts of weak pulses break postictal inhibition in the neocortex of Wistar rats?,It is apparent that weak stimulation can trigger epileptic phenomena during PI. Our results indicate that it is no longer possible to perceive PI only as persisting extreme and active inhibition. An appropriate stimulation can reveal more subtle (but important) excitatory events contributing to the functional status during the postictal period.
Does two-hour insulin determination improve the ability of abdominal fat measurement to identify risk for the metabolic syndrome?,"While BMI was unable to differentiate between obese people and those at higher risk for MS, abdominal fat was shown to be associated with its metabolic abnormalities. The usefulness of abdominal fat in the identification of high-risk subjects may be improved when combined with 2-h insulin determination."
Are angiogenesis and dendritic cell density correlated with metachronous distant metastasis in curatively operated rectal cancer?,Angiogenesis and dendritic cell density are not prognostic factors for metachronous distant metastasis in rectal cancer and therefore cannot serve as selection parameters for adjuvant therapy.
Are dermatologist detection and skin self-examination associated with thinner melanomas : results from a survey of the Italian Multidisciplinary Group on Melanoma?,"Future melanoma early diagnosis strategies should adequately stress the role of skin self-examination among the adult population, and should recommend that dermatologists perform a total skin examination to identify suspect lesions (such an examination should also be performed during consultations for other reasons)."
Do pyrethroid insecticides influence the signal transduction in T helper lymphocytes from atopic and nonatopic subjects?,"It can be suggested that pyrethroids inhibit signal transduction in human lymphocytes ex vivo, and do not act via lymphocyte-influencing histamine release."
Is [ No switch region found in the regulatory sequence of HPV 16 for promoter P97 ]?,It suggests that there is no such switch region within HPV 16 transcriptional regulatory region.
Does [ Establishment of a method for classification of HBV genome and it 's application ]?,"The established method for genotyping is simple and convenient. Using this method, we also classified HBV DNA of the patients with chronic hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis living in Guangzhou, and found that mixed genotypes B and C was in 50.0% of the patients detected, suggesting the mixed infection might lead to a severe damage of the liver tissue."
Do cryo-thawed embryos obtained from conception cycles have double the implantation and pregnancy potential of those from unsuccessful cycles?,"After thawing, cryopreserved embryos originating from conception IVF/ICSI cycles achieve double the implantation and pregnancy rates of those obtained from unsuccessful cycles."
Do psychological distress and pain significantly increase before death in metastatic breast cancer patients?,"Results suggest that specialized end-stage clinical interventions are particularly needed for cancer patients as they approach death. Moreover, intervention studies for patients with deteriorating illnesses may need to take this ""spike"" in psychological distress and pain proximal to death into account to avoid Type II errors in evaluations of psychological outcomes."
Does optimization of low pre-operative hemoglobin reduce transfusion requirement in patients undergoing transurethral resection of prostate?,"Operative time, weight of resected prostate tissue are inter related and are only partly controllable. Low pre-operative hemoglobin is the only reversible factor in reducing transfusion following TURP."
"Are influence of race in heart failure and cardiac transplantation : mortality differences eliminated by specialized , comprehensive care?","Delivery of care to heart failure patients in a comprehensive, specialized program results in similar survival regardless of race despite higher utilization of inpatient and outpatient resources. The finding that, after cardiac transplantation, African Americans do not have higher mortality rates, despite having higher rates of rejection overall and more hospitalizations, further supports the hypothesis that optimal care can improve outcomes despite unfavorable baseline clinical characteristics."
"Is temozolomide active in childhood , progressive , unresectable , low-grade gliomas?",Temozolomide is active in children with LGGs. It is effective in previously treated patients and in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. The 42-day regimen appears less toxic than the 5-day regimen. Any impact on survival for these patients remains to be demonstrated.

Is percent change in wound area of diabetic foot ulcers over a 4-week period a robust predictor of complete healing in a 12-week prospective trial?,The percent change in foot ulcer area after 4 weeks of observation is a robust predictor of healing at 12 weeks. This simple tool may serve as a pivotal clinical decision point in the care of diabetic foot ulcers for early identification of patients who may not respond to standard care and may need additional treatment.
Does neurobehavioral disinhibition in childhood predict early age at onset of substance use disorder?,Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses indicated that neurobehavioral disinhibition is a component of the liability to early age at onset of substance use disorder.
Does mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow facilitate heart transplantation in older infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome?,Pre-transplant mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow simplified management and reduced morbidity for HLHS patients undergoing heart transplantation at ages >or=4 months. This strategy extends the permissible transplant waiting time in older infants with HLHS.
Does [ Removal of YY1 binding sites in HPV 16 LCR increase viral transforming activities on mouse fibroblasts ]?,"Like in epithelial cells or cell lines, transcription regulator YY1 is widely expressed in rodent fibroblasts. Removal of YY1 binding motifs can elevate in the context of the whole genome, the anchorage independent growth ability and the transforming capacity of HPV 16 on the mouse fibroblasts."
Does interleukin-10 inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase in an animal model of necrotizing enterocolitis?,IL-10 decreases iNOS mRNA response in experimental NEC. This down-regulation may be an avenue for anti-inflammatory intervention in NEC.
Does direct contact between human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and renal fibroblasts facilitate the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1?,"It is suggested that the interaction between renal fibroblasts and PBMC was mediated through direct contact and by secreted humoral factors. ICAM-1 on renal fibroblasts may be involved in the direct cell-to-cell interaction inducing MCP-1 gene expression, which seems to be involved in renal interstitial inflammation."
Is body mass index inversely related to mortality in older people after adjustment for waist circumference?,"Higher BMI values indicated a lower mortality risk once the risk attributable to WC was accounted for, whereas higher WC values indicate a higher mortality risk once the risk attributable to BMI was accounted for. Both BMI and WC should be measured in the clinical setting, but in older adults higher BMI is associated with lower mortality rates."
Does pituitary tumor-transforming gene regulate multiple downstream angiogenic genes in thyroid cancer?,We have identified ID3 and TSP-1 as two new downstream targets of PTTG in thyroid cancer. We propose that PTTG may promote angiogenesis by regulating the expression of multiple genes with both pro- and antiangiogenic properties and may thus be a key gene in triggering the angiogenic switch in thyroid tumorigenesis.
"Are low sex hormone-binding globulin , total testosterone , and symptomatic androgen deficiency associated with development of the metabolic syndrome in nonobese men?","Low serum SHBG, low total testosterone, and clinical AD are associated with increased risk of developing MetS over time, particularly in nonoverweight, middle-aged men (BMI, <25). Together, these results suggest that low SHBG and/or AD may provide early warning signs for cardiovascular risk and an opportunity for early intervention in nonobese men."
Does prevalence and correlate of ADHD symptoms in the national health interview survey?,"ADHD symptoms vary by race and ethnicity, gender, and age and are associated with other emotional and behavioral difficulties. Both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of ADHD may be issues in the U.S. population of 4- to 17-year-olds."
Is adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy in childhood associated with atopic disease later in life?,Our data show no association between adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy in childhood and the incidence of atopic disease in young adults.
Are vascular endothelial growth factor plasma levels significantly elevated in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations?,Our findings suggest that VEGF plasma concentrations might play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral AVMs. Further studies are necessary and would contribute to an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of cerebral AVMs.
Do telomerase-specific T-cells kill pancreatic tumor cells in vitro and in vivo?,"Generation of antigen-specific T-cells is feasible; the expansion of these cells could be accomplished without loss of function. Antigen-specific T-cells demonstrated significant cytotoxic activity in a syngeneic, subcutaneous mouse model. However, further optimization of the expansion protocol is warranted."
Does intensive continuing medical education course training on simulators result in proficiency for laparoscopic suturing?,"Although 4 hours may be insufficient for some trainees, an intensive half-day CME course is feasible and effective in significantly improving performance and allowing the majority of participants to achieve proficiency."
Do abdominal positron-emission tomography lesions with increased standardized uptake values correlate with intraoperative findings?,This initial study indicates patients with potentially resectable disease by PET scan but decreased FDG uptake should undergo laparoscopic evaluation before performing laparotomy.
Do common polymorphisms of the growth hormone ( GH ) receptor correlate with the growth response to exogenous recombinant human GH in GH-deficient children?,"The most common GHR polymorphisms, alone or in association, do not appear to affect the growth response to rhGH in GHD children."
Is simulation-based training superior to problem-based learning for the acquisition of critical assessment and management skills?,"For fourth-year medical students, simulation-based learning was superior to problem-based learning for the acquisition of critical assessment and management skills."
Does cXCL12 attract CXCR4+ human metastatic neuroblastoma cells : clinical implications?,These results show unambiguously that CXCR4 expressed in human metastatic neuroblastoma cells is not functional and do not support the clinical use of CXCR4 antagonists to prevent neuroblastoma metastasis.
Are clinical effects of probiotics associated with increased interferon-gamma responses in very young children with atopic dermatitis?,"The improvement in AD severity with probiotic treatment was associated with significant increases in the capacity for Th1 IFN-gamma responses and altered responses to skin and enteric flora. This effect was still evident 2 months after the supplementation was ceased. The lack of consistent effects on allergen-specific responses suggests that the effects of probiotics may be mediated through other independent pathways, which need to be explored further."

Does the WAVE2 complex regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization and CRAC-mediated calcium entry during T cell activation?,"These data reveal a role for WAVE2 in regulating multiple pathways leading to T cell activation. In particular, this work shows that WAVE2 is a key component of the actin regulatory machinery in T cells and that it also participates in linking intracellular calcium store depletion to calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel activation."
Does treatment with Met-RANTES decrease bacterial translocation in experimental colitis?,These results suggest that chemokine receptor antagonists may potentially be useful in the treatment of IBDs.
Is an absent pulse sensitive for the early detection of peripheral arterial disease?,Pulse palpation is not sensitive for the detection of PAD compared to ABI. More than two thirds of the patients within our cohort with PAD of either the left or right leg had a detectable pulse.
Is lymphovascular invasion associated with poor survival in gastric cancer : an application of gene-expression and tissue array techniques?,LVI was an independent predictor of survival in gastric cancer. Expression of COX-2 may facilitate tumor invasion through MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation. OPHN1 and RPN II appeared to be differentially expressed in gastric cancers exhibiting LVI. The reported function of OPHN1 and RPN II makes these gene products promising candidates for future studies involving LVI in gastric cancer.
Does the effect of telephone appointment-reminder call on outpatient absenteeism in a pulmonary function laboratory?,A policy of reminding outpatients of their appointments via telephone reduces absenteeism at a hospital-based pulmonary function laboratory. We found no difference in absenteeism between communicating the reminder via direct conversation versus via leaving a message on an answering machine.
Does adjustment of antibiotic treatment according to the results of blood cultures lead to decreased antibiotic use and costs?,Adjustment of antibiotic therapy according to the results of blood cultures led to a reduction in the number of antibiotics and a narrowing of antibiotic therapy. The costs for antibiotics decreased.
Does glasgow Aneurysm Score predict survival after endovascular stenting of abdominal aortic aneurysm in patients from the EUROSTAR registry?,"The GAS was effective in predicting outcome after EVAR. Because its efficacy has also been shown in patients undergoing open repair of AAA, it can be used to aid decisions about treatment in all patients with an AAA."
Does transesophageal echocardiography disclose unexpected cardiac sources of embolus in stroke patients aged more than 45 years?,"TEE is widely used to diagnose cardiac source of cerebral embolism in young patients, but it seems to be as useful for older ones, in whom cerebral embolism risk is underestimated; atherogenic and cardioembolic causes may actually coexist, and both should be treated."
Do academic mothers have a pronounced seasonal variation in their offspring sex ratio?,We conclude that the significant seasonal variation of the SRB in academic women cannot be merely interpreted as an effect of socio-economic status but more likely as the interaction between socio-economic and environmental working conditions.
Is routine once-weekly darbepoetin alfa administration cost-effective in lung cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia : a Markov analysis?,Routine use of RHE appears to be cost-effective in patients receiving chemotherapy for lung cancer.
Does riboflavin lower homocysteine in individuals homozygous for the MTHFR 677C- > T polymorphism?,"Although previously overlooked, homocysteine is highly responsive to riboflavin, specifically in individuals with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype. Our findings might explain why this common polymorphism carries an increased risk of coronary heart disease in Europe but not in North America, where riboflavin fortification has existed for >50 years."
Is the value of onsite adequacy assessment of thyroid fine-needle aspirations a function of operator experience?,"The results of the current study demonstrate that onsite adequacy assessment of thyroid FNAs significantly reduces the number of nondiagnostic aspirates. However, the benefit of onsite evaluation, at least for US-guided FNAs, depends on the experience of the radiologist. In the current study, experienced radiologists with a relatively low nondiagnostic rate did not benefit from onsite adequacy assessment. This finding confirms the importance of experience in the performance of FNA, but suggests that onsite adequacy assessment may assist the less experienced operator."
Is migraine with aura a risk factor for unprovoked seizures in children?,Children with migraine with aura have a substantial increased risk to develop subsequent epilepsy. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that migraine with aura and migraine without aura may be different disorders.
Are substantia nigra tangles related to gait impairment in older persons?,NFTs in the substantia nigra are associated with gait impairment in older persons with and without dementia.

Are heterozygous mutations in natriuretic peptide receptor-B ( NPR2 ) associated with short stature?,"We have shown that heterozygous mutations in NPR2 are associated with short stature. Assuming one in 700 people unknowingly carry an NPR2 mutation, our data suggest that approximately one in 30 individuals with idiopathic short stature are carriers of NPR2 mutations."
Do total IgE levels change 1 year after endoscopic sinus surgery in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis?,"The levels of total serum IgE do not change after sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis. IgE levels in chronic rhinosinusitis may reflect a systemic factor in disease pathogenesis, and are probably not related to the amount of local inflammation within the sinuses."
Is the TRP2 allele of COL9A2 an age-dependent risk factor for the development and severity of intervertebral disc degeneration?,This largest-ever population study using MRI to define DDD demonstrates for the first time that the Trp2 allele is a significant risk factor for the development and severity of degeneration. The association is age- dependent as it is more prevalent in some age groups than in others. The contrasting Trp allele frequencies between the Finns and the Chinese are the first indication that the genetic risk factors for DDD varies between ethnic groups.
Does planimetric assessment of anatomic valve area overestimate effective orifice area in bicuspid aortic stenosis?,"For a given anatomic orifice, functional severity tends to be greater in bicuspid AS than in tricuspid AS. This appears to be primarily related to greater jet eccentricity and less pressure recovery."
Is balloon kyphoplasty effective in deformity correction of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures?,The restoration of height in kyphoplasty is attributed to dynamic fracture mobility as well as to the expansion of the inserted balloon tamp.
"Are genetic polymorphisms of CD14 , toll-like receptor 4 , and caspase-recruitment domain 15 associated with necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants?","Carrier state of the tested CD14, TLR4, and CARD15 SNPs is not associated with NEC risk in VLBW infants."
Does gleason scoring vary among pathologists and this affects clinical risk in patients with prostate cancer?,"Our findings confirm previous reports of only limited correlation between pathologists in reporting Gleason sums. In this study, 19% (16/83) of cases had their grading changed to a level that altered clinical risk, almost always (94%; 15/16) to one that worsened prognosis. This would have significantly affected treatment strategy for these patients, and thus we recommend that all centres ensure accurate Gleason grading by the use of pathologists with special interests in prostate cancer."
Are flow-dependent changes in Doppler-derived aortic valve effective orifice area real and not due to artifact?,The flow-dependent changes in EOA(Dop) are not artifacts but represent real changes in EOA attributable either to unsteady effects at low flow rates and/or to changes in valve leaflet opening. Such changes in EOA(Dop) can be relied on for clinical judgment making.
Does cryopreservation of hematopoietic progenitor cells from apheresis at high cell concentrations impair the hematopoietic recovery after transplantation?,The cryopreservation of HPC-A at higher than standard NC concentrations has no adverse impact on hematopoietic reconstitution after transplantation.
Does desensitization to strong vestibular stimuli improve tolerance to simulated aircraft motion?,Our results suggest that desensitization to one provocative motion could be transferred to a less severe motion stimulus. This result could be used in the refinement of desensitization programs for aircrew.
Is h244R VSX1 associated with selective cone ON bipolar cell dysfunction and macular degeneration in a PPCD family?,"The human VSX1 is required for cone ON bipolar cell function but not for rod and cone OFF bipolar cells, giving a unique example of such a selective heritable retinal defect in humans. Furthermore, the authors provide the first clinical support for a new alternative role of VSX1 in cone biology, probably similar to that proposed for its goldfish ortholog during retinal differentiation."
Is evolution of the renal function a better predictor of long-term survival than serum creatinine?,The evolution of renal function at 3 months and throughout the evolution were better predictors of graft failure than an isolated serum creatinine value.
Is [ Cell-cycle negative regulatory gene ANA over-expressed in the brain tissues of patients with Down syndrome ]?,Over-expression of ANA may contribute to the reduction of neuronal density in DS brain.
Does reg IV activate the epidermal growth factor receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway in colon adenocarcinomas?,Reg IV is a potent activator of the EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway in CRC. Disruption of Reg signaling may have utility as a therapeutic intervention for human gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.
Do myofibroblast matrix metalloproteinases activate the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL7 from intestinal epithelial cells?,These findings identify a novel proinflammatory action of MMPs in inflammation and suggest that lamina propria myofibroblasts are required to achieve maximal intestinal epithelial immune activation.
Is left atrial index a predictor of exercise capacity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"LA volume index, reflecting the combined influences of MR and diastolic dysfunction, was independently associated with objective measures of exercise capacity in patients with isolated HCM."
Does bispectral index monitoring improve early recovery of geriatric outpatients undergoing brief surgical procedures?,"In this non-paralyzed elderly outpatient surgery population, the use of BIS monitoring for titrating the maintenance anesthetic (sevoflurane) failed to improve the early recovery process."
Do dietary gangliosides enhance in vitro lipid uptake in weanling rats?,We speculate that the enhanced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in weanling rats fed GANG may be caused by a modification in physical properties of the BBM.
"Does 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine enhance the release of acetylcholine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus of the rat?","MDMA exerts a stimulatory effect on the release of ACh in the PFC and dorsal hippocampus in vivo, possibly by mechanisms localized within these brain regions. In addition, these results suggest that the MDMA-induced release of ACh in the PFC involves both serotonergic and dopaminergic mechanisms."
"Are physical distance , genetic relationship , age , and leprosy classification independent risk factors for leprosy in contacts of patients with leprosy?","Age of the contact, the disease classification of the index patient, and physical and genetic distance were independently associated with the risk of a contact acquiring leprosy. Contact surveys in leprosy should be not only focused on household contacts but also extended to neighbors and consanguineous relatives, especially when the patient has PB2-5 or MB leprosy."
"Is macrophage migration inhibition factor elevated in pregnancy , but not to a greater extent in preeclampsia?","Our data suggest that circulatory MIF concentrations are elevated throughout pregnancy, but are not further increased in preeclampsia."
Is ileum resection the most predictive factor for osteoporosis in patients with Crohn 's disease?,"Our data suggest that in patients with Crohn's disease, the risk of osteoporosis is best predicted by a history of ileum resection."
Is lorazepam an independent risk factor for transitioning to delirium in intensive care unit patients?,Lorazepam administration is an important and potentially modifiable risk factor for transitioning into delirium even after adjusting for relevant covariates.
Do cTLA4Ig introduced by adenovirus vector locally to prolong the survival of xenogeneic skin grafts on rat burn wounds?,Administration of Ad-CTLA4Ig locally could prolong the survival time of xenogeneic skin graft on burn wound without significantly influencing the systemic immune function.
Does leflunomide prevent alveolar fluid clearance inhibition by respiratory syncytial virus?,Pyrimidine synthesis or release pathways may provide novel therapeutic targets to counter the pathophysiologic sequelae of impaired AFC in RSV disease.
Does surgery for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage have greater remedial value than conservative therapy?,"Surgically treated patients, especially those with cerebellar hemorrhage, had significantly greater improvement in NIHSS or JSS score compared with medically treated patients. Our findings indicated that the patients who underwent surgery appeared to have better outcomes. But, because the study was not randomized, this observation cannot be interpreted as indicating that surgery is advantageous."
Do detection rate of ultrasound vs CT scan in clinical staging accuracy of renal tumors pT1NxMx?,Ultrasound is the first step in the staging of renal cancer before surgery; to assess. 2.5 and 7 in diameter CT scan is the gold standard for solid and cystic lesions.
Does addition of cladribine to induction/consolidation regimen impair peripheral blood stem cell mobilization and bone marrow harvest for autotransplantation in acute myeloid leukemia patients?,Addition of cladribine to a standard DA induction does not impair the harvesting of hematopoietic cells and their engraftment after autotransplantation.
Does continuing education need assessment of acute care and long-term-care nurses in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center?,"Conducting a needs assessment can provide valuable information that will improve the delivery of high quality, relevant continuing education and improve staff satisfaction."
Does the CC chemokine eotaxin/CCL11 have a selective profibrogenic effect on human lung fibroblasts?,"These data demonstrate that eotaxin/CCL11 has a direct and selective profibrogenic effect on lung and bronchial fibroblasts, providing a novel mechanism whereby eotaxin/CCL11 can participate in airway remodeling in asthma."
Does repeated administration of adenovector in the eye result in efficient gene delivery?,"These studies suggest that transgene expression after repeated adenovector administration into the eye is feasible and repeated injections, whether given IVT or PO, do not lead to an immediate increase in neutralizing anti-Ad antibody titers. Moreover, preimmunization of mice by systemic exposure to adenovector, does not block transgene expression in the eye. These studies indicate that repeat administration of adenovectors (IVT and PO) into the eye can be considered in designing future clinical trials and that the pre-existence of neutralizing anti-Ad antibodies probably does not mitigate activity."
Is impaired glucose tolerance of pregnancy a heterogeneous metabolic disorder as defined by the glycemic response to the oral glucose tolerance test?,"The metabolic implications of IGT in pregnancy vary in relation to the timing of the abnormal glucose value from the diagnostic OGTT. The metabolic phenotype associated with 1-h IGT resembles that of GDM, whereas the phenotype associated with 2-h/3-h IGT exhibits similarity to that of NGT."
Do antioxidant supplements prevent oxidation of cysteine/cystine redox in patients with age-related macular degeneration?,"The AREDS antioxidant supplements reduced oxidation of E(h) Cys but had no effect on GSH. Because Cys is important for cell growth, apoptosis, and immune function, the beneficial effect of antioxidant supplementation on progression to advanced AMD may be partially explained by its effect on E(h) Cys and/or its effect on Cys availability."
Does pacemaker stress echocardiography predict cardiac events in patients with permanent pacemaker?,Myocardial ischemia during pacemaker stress echocardiography is an independent predictor of cardiac death and all-cause mortality in patients with a permanent pacemaker.
Does aCE-inhibitor treatment attenuate atrial structural remodeling in patients with lone chronic atrial fibrillation?,In patients undergoing ACE-I treatment: atrial structural remodeling was attenuated and the loss of atrial microcapillaries was prevented.

Is posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder common in parents of children with epilepsy?,These findings suggest that a significant proportion of parents of children with epilepsy experience PTSD and MDD. Increased awareness of the clinical presentations of these disorders may help clinicians to develop preventive and intervention strategies for parents of children with epilepsy.
Does folic acid supplementation reduce the development of some blood cell abnormalities in children receiving carbamazepine?,"Folic acid is a safe drug that can reduce the development of some blood cell abnormalities linked to carbamazepine. It has a favorable effect on preventing the leukopenia and drop in hemoglobin observed in patients receiving carbamazepine, but its exact effect and the optimal dose required to enhance its benefits require further investigation."
Is eosinophilia in the upper gastrointestinal tract a characteristic feature in cow 's milk sensitive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease . Measurement by two methodologies?,"CMH was found not only in infants but also in school age children with GERD. Histology did not identify the cow's milk sensitive GERD subgroup. The computerised histological method provides a more complete evaluation based upon total biopsy area, and helped to limit the bias of uneven biopsy size."
Does minimal extrathyroid extension affect the relapse-free survival of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma measuring 4 cm or less over the age of 45 years?,"These findings suggest that tumors with minimal extension should be classified to have the same T grade as those without such extension, and upstaging of such tumors is therefore not appropriate."
Are plasma LDL and HDL characteristics and carotenoid content positively influenced by egg consumption in an elderly population?,"These findings suggest that the increases in LDL-C and HDL-C due to increased egg consumption in hyper-responders are not related to an increased number of LDL or HDL particles but, to an increase in the less atherogenic lipoprotein subfractions. Also, increases in plasma carotenoids after EGG may provide a valuable dietary source for this population."
"Is a vector-based , 5-electrode , 12-lead monitoring ECG ( EASI ) equivalent to conventional 12-lead ECG for diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes?",EASI is equivalent to cECG for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia.
Does carvedilol exert more potent antiadrenergic effect than metoprolol in heart failure?,Carvedilol exerts a more potent antiadrenergic effect than metoprolol during stress in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Carvedilol appears to be more efficacious than metoprolol in patients who exhibit higher baseline brain natriuretic peptide concentrations. These differences should be kept in mind when selecting appropriate pharmacologic agents in the treatment of heart failure.
Do radiological findings support lateral residual tumour as a major cause of local recurrence of rectal cancer?,Lateral pelvic lymph node metastases are not a major cause of local recurrence after TME. Partial mesorectal excision may be associated with an increased risk of local recurrence from tumours in the upper rectum.
Do biphasic chromatin structure and FISH signals in reflect intranuclear order?,"A small number of cells (up to about 5%), more frequent in leukemia cases, showed the twin features: (1) nuclei with biphasic chromatin, one part decondensed and the other condensed; and (2) homologous FISH signals distributed equitably in those two regions. The biphasic chromatin structure with equitable distribution of the homologous FISH signals may correspond to the two sets of chromosomes, supporting observations on ploidywise intranuclear order. The decondensed chromatin may relate to enhanced transcriptions or advanced replications."
Do physical activity and restlessness correlate with leptin levels in patients with adolescent anorexia nervosa?,This is the first study linking hypoleptinemia in AN patients to subjective and objective measures of higher physical activity and motor and inner restlessness. Leptin may directly or indirectly (or both) influence behaviors and cognitions contributing to hyperactivity and motor restlessness.
Does transfection of CD40Ig into liver prevent acute rejection in rat liver transplantation?,"CD40Ig transfection inhibited T-cell costimulatory pathway, prevented acute rejection, and prolonged graft survival."
Does motor cortical excitability remain unaffected of short-term hyperglycemia in Type 1 diabetic patients?,The excitability of motor cortex and central motor nerve conduction in Type 1 diabetic patients are unaffected by short-term moderate hyperglycemia as compared with normoglycemia.
Are meal and snack patterns associated with dietary intake of energy and nutrients in US adults?,Findings from this cross-sectional survey suggest that meal and snack patterns may be markers for nutrient intakes and therefore diet quality. Complete nutrient intakes should be considered in investigations of meal patterns and health outcomes.
Is antibody immunity to the p53 oncogenic protein a prognostic indicator in ovarian cancer?,Data presented here demonstrate that advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can have detectable tumor-specific antibody immunity and that immunity to p53 may predict improved overall survival in patients with advanced-stage disease.
Are bone mineral density and bone histomorphometry statistically related?,The results of this study support the use of QCT to assess the bone quality before implant placement to improve the planning of implant treatment.
Is increased serum resistin in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease related to liver disease severity and not to insulin resistance?,"Both NAFLD and obese patients had lower adiponectin levels, whereas leptin was increased only in the obese group. No correlation was found between resistin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, BMI, homeostasis model assessment, insulin, glucose, transaminases, and lipid values. A positive correlation was found between resistin and histological inflammatory score. These data report increased resistin in NAFLD patients that is related to the histological severity of the disease, but do not support a link between resistin and insulin resistance or BMI in these patients."
Do lifestyle risk factors predict healthcare costs in an aging cohort?,"Seniors who were leaner, smoked fewer cigarettes over a lifetime, reduced their smoking, or walked farther had significant subsequent cost savings compared to those with less-healthy lifestyle-related habits."
"Is pulmonary arterial hypertension a major mortality factor in diffuse systemic sclerosis , independent of interstitial lung disease?","These results indicate that, independent of ILD, PAH is a major prognostic factor for survival in dcSSc."
Are pyridine N-oxide derivatives inhibitory to the human SARS and feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus in cell culture?,"A wide variety of pyridine N-oxide derivatives have been found to be inhibitory against feline coronavirus (FIPV strain) and human SARS-CoV (Frankfurt strain-1) in CRFK and simian kidney (Vero) cell cultures, respectively. The oxide part on the pyridine moiety proved indispensable for anti-coronavirus activity. The potency and virus specificity of the pyridine N-oxide derivatives varied depending the nature and specific location of substituents (i.e. alkyl, halogeno, nitro, etc.) on the different parts of the molecule. The most selective compounds were active in the higher microgram per litre range, being non-toxic at 50-100 mg/L. There was a poor structure-antiviral activity relationship (SAR) for the pyridine N-oxide derivatives against Fe-CoV and SARS-CoV. One of the most active and selective compounds was shown to inhibit Fe-CoV replication at the transcriptional level."
Does increased myocardial performance index correlate with biopsy-proven rejection in pediatric heart transplant recipients?,"In this series, increased LVMPI correlated with biopsy-proven rejection, and frequent serial assessments using this technique may provide a relatively sensitive non-invasive means of rejection surveillance after pediatric cardiac transplantation. False positive results may be encountered, likely due to alterations in diastolic function that have been previously observed in transplant recipients."
Does reduced expression of CAMTA1 correlate with adverse outcome in neuroblastoma patients?,Our data suggest that assessment of CAMTA1 expression may improve the prognostic models for neuroblastoma and that it will be important to define the biological function of CAMTA1 in this disease.
Does periodic direct current promote wound closure in an in vitro dynamic model of cell migration?,"Contrary to the authors' expectations, they found that periodic DC did not promote wound closure, a finding that emphasizes the need to clarify the complex effects of electrical fields on migrating cells."
Does feeding an elemental diet vs a milk-based formula decrease intestinal mucosal growth in infant pigs?,"We conclude that intestinal mucosal growth and villus morphology are similar in pigs fed ED and FORM, despite higher cell proliferation and protein synthesis rates and lower lactase activity with ED. This implies that elemental diets may be as trophic as polymeric formulas to simultaneously provide nutrition and a stimulus for intestinal growth during bowel rest."
Is fractional anisotropy higher in Heschl 's gyrus than in superior temporal gyrus in normal subjects?,The FA in the subcortical white matter of the HG was higher than that of the STG in both hemispheres. These changes in DT imaging may be accounted for by the presence of the auditory radiations.
Is therapy with natalizumab associated with high JCV seroconversion and rising JCV index values?,JCV seroconversion and index values may be influenced by treatment with natalizumab. It is therefore important to monitor patients' JCV serology but also to incorporate additional risk factors into the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy risk stratification.
Does multidimensional endotyping in patients with severe asthma reveal inflammatory heterogeneity in matrix metalloproteinases and chitinase 3-like protein 1?,"In 2 distinct cohorts we have identified and replicated 6 clinicopathobiologic clusters based on blood and induced sputum measures. Our data underline a disconnect between clinical features and underlying inflammation, suggest IL-5 production is relatively steroid insensitive, and highlight the expression of YKL-40 in patients with neutrophilic inflammation and the expression of MMPs in patients with severe asthma."
Does matrix metalloproteinase-9 deletion rescue auditory evoked potential habituation deficit in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome?,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery."
Are thirty percent of abstracts presented at dental conferences published in full : a systematic review?,Less than one-third of abstracts presented at dental conferences were published in full more than 4 years after conference presentation.
Does molecular Staging of Sentinel Lymph Nodes identify Melanoma Patients at Increased Risk of Nodal Recurrence?,"Patients with microscopically negative/PCR+ SLN have an increased risk of nodal recurrence that was mitigated by CLND. Although CLND did not affect OS, these data suggest that molecular detection of melanoma-specific mRNA in the SLN predicts a greater risk of nodal recurrence and deserves further study."
Does a biophysical model of supercoiling dependent transcription predict a structural aspect to gene regulation?,"Our model, incorporating the supercoiling state of the gene, makes specific predictions that differ from previous models of gene expression. Genes in the same supercoiling domain influence the expression level of neighboring genes. Such structurally dependent regulation predicts correlations between genes in the same supercoiling domain. The topology of the chromosome therefore creates a higher level of gene regulation, which has broad implications for understanding the evolution and organization of bacterial genomes."
Is tuberculous Pericarditis Multibacillary and Bacterial Burden Drives High Mortality?,"Patients with culture confirmed tuberculous pericarditis have a high bacillary burden, and this bacterial burden drives mortality. Thus proven tuberculosis pericarditis is not a paucibacillary disease. Moreover, the severe immunosuppression suggests limited inflammation. There is a need for the design of a highly bactericidal regimen for this condition."
Does ocular Fluid Analysis in Children reveal Interleukin-29/Interferon-λ1 as a Biomarker for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis-Associated Uveitis?,"We identified IL-29/IFNλ1 as an intraocular biomarker for JIA-associated uveitis, which suggests that aberrant IFNλ signaling might be important in JIA-associated uveitis and distinct from other forms of childhood uveitis."
Do glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms modulate cardiometabolic risk factors in patients in long-term remission of Cushing 's syndrome?,The 9β and BclI polymorphisms of the GR adversely affect the cardiometabolic profile in patients who are in remission after the treatment of CS. This suggests that genetically altered GC sensitivity modulates the long-term adverse cardiometabolic effects resulting from (endogenous) hypercortisolism.
Is `` Food Addiction '' in Patients with Eating Disorders Associated with Negative Urgency and Difficulties to Focus on Long-Term Goals?,Eating disorder patients who have more problems to pursue tasks to the end and to focus on long-term goals seem to be more likely to develop addictive eating patterns.

Does reasons for discrepancies in hip fracture risk estimate using FRAX and Garvan calculators?,"Hip fracture risk estimates are usually higher with Garvan than FRAX, and these differences could impact on treatment decisions in about a quarter of patients. Falls and multiple fractures have a strong influence on Garvan risk estimates, when present. Clinically important discrepancies tend to occur in patients who are at borderline fracture risk. In patients with hip fracture risks near the treatment threshold with one calculator, use of the other calculator should be considered to help guide treatment decisions."
Does an integrated molecular landscape implicate the regulation of dendritic spine formation through insulin-related signalling in obsessive-compulsive disorder?,"This study is a first attempt to integrate molecuar information from different sources in order to identify biological mechanisms underlying OCD etiology. Our findings are constrained by the limited information from hypothesis-free studies and the incompleteness and existing limitations of the OCD literature and the gene function annotations of gene enrichment tools. As this study was solely based on in silico analyses, experimental validation of the provided hypotheses is warranted."
Does the MacNew Questionnaire be a Helpful Tool for Predicting Unplanned Hospital Readmissions After Coronary Revascularization?,A relatively elevated MacNew global score appears to be associated with a significantly decreased risk of unscheduled hospitalizations after coronary revascularization over a 3-year follow-up.
Is the face bow irrelevant for making prostheses and planning orthognathic surgery?,Eliminating the face bow transfer reduces the patient's chair time and the dentist's overhead expenses. The author found evidence in the results of randomized controlled trials and an online video that justify eliminating the use and teaching of the 133-year-old technique known as the face bow transfer.
Does tissue-Engineered Skin Substitute enhance Wound Healing after Radiation Therapy?,These results indicate that BTESS is the preferred treatment for irradiated wound ulcers.
Is placental MFSD2a transporter related to decreased DHA in cord blood of women with treated gestational diabetes?,"In offspring of women with GDM treated either with diet or insulin, higher fetal fat accretion and lower placental MFSD2a contribute to reduce DHA availability. Lyso-PL appear to contribute to materno-fetal DHA transport."
Does branched-chain amino acid supplementation attenuate a decrease in power-producing ability following acute strength training?,BCAA administered acutely before and following intensive ST attenuates a decrease in power-producing ability experienced by resistance-trained males. The apparent small but significant effects on functional power suggest that BCAA is an effective ergogenic aid for athletes who require augmented recovery of power-producing ability following intensive ST.
Are isolated tumor cells in stage I & II colon cancer patients associated with significantly worse disease-free and overall survival?,"This study provides compelling evidence that ITC in stage I & II colon cancer patients are associated with significantly worse disease-free and overall survival. Based on these data, the presence of ITC should be classified as a high risk factor in stage I & II colon cancer patients who might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy."
Are failure of tooth eruption and brachydactyly in pseudohypoparathyroidism related to plasma parathyroid hormone-related protein levels?,"We described the dental abnormalities in a large series of PHP patients that were followed in a single tertiary center. No relationship between plasma PTHrP levels and failure of tooth eruption, dental manifestations of PHP or brachydactyly was found. It is important that doctors pay attention to dental manifestations of the disease in order to refer patients to a proper care with dentists."
Does a Common Polymorphism in a Williams Syndrome Gene predict Amygdala Reactivity and Extraversion in Healthy Adults?,"A common polymorphism in the WS gene GTF2I associated with reduced social anxiety predicts decreased threat-related amygdala reactivity, which mediates an association between genotype and increased warmth in women. These results are consistent with reduced threat-related amygdala reactivity in WS and suggest that common variation in GTF2I contributes to broader variability in socioemotional brain function and behavior, with implications for understanding the neurogenetic bases of WS as well as social anxiety."
Does subjective memory decline predict greater rates of clinical progression in preclinical Alzheimer 's disease?,"High SMD is a harbinger of greater rates of clinical progression in preclinical AD. Although SMD reflects broader diagnostic implications for CN Aβ+, more sensitive measures may be required to detect early subtle cognitive change."
Does select Bcl-2 antagonism restore chemotherapy sensitivity in high-risk neuroblastoma?,"HR NB patients are often thrombocytopenic at relapse, raising concerns for therapies like ABT-263 despite its HR NB tumor targeting potential. Our data confirms that Bcl-2 selective inhibitors like ABT-199 are equally potent in HR NB in vitro and in vivo and given their lack of platelet toxicity, should be translated into the clinic for HR NB."
Does chromogranin A predict survival for resected pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"In patients with resected pNETs, an elevated preoperative CgA level was negatively associated with DFS and OS and was the only independent predictor of DFS. These results indicate that preoperative CgA may be a clinically useful prognostic marker for patients undergoing pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor resection."
Are guideline-concordant weight-loss programs in an urban area uncommon and difficult to identify through the internet?,"Most weight-loss programs in an urban, mid-Atlantic region do not currently offer guideline-concordant practices and fail to disclose key information online, which may make clinician referrals challenging."
Are video capsule endoscopy completion and total transit times similar with oral or endoscopic delivery?,"VCE completion rates and total transit times are similar after oral or endoscopic deployment for both hospitalized and ambulatory patients. Endoscopic placement is effective in patients with contraindications to standard oral ingestion, but should otherwise be avoided to limit unnecessary procedural risks and costs."
Do extracellular vesicles participate in the transport of cytokines and angiogenic factors in diabetic patients with ocular complications?,"The profiles of cytokines and angiogenic factors in EVs are significantly increased in patients with diabetes. Also, the formation of specific cytokines related to EVs is strongly influenced by disease duration and successful treatment. EVs seem to be the conveyors of upregulated cytokines and angiogenic agents in diabetic patients."
Is very early social support following mild stroke associated with emotional and behavioral outcomes three months later?,"Patient perceptions of better support quality, and not quantity, immediately following mild stroke, are associated with better behavioral and emotional outcomes three months later."
Is receipt of Care Discordant with Practice Guidelines Associated with Compromised Overall Survival in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma?,Many patients with stages I and IVC nasopharyngeal carcinoma do not receive care in accordance with practice guidelines. Receiving guidelines-discordant care is associated with compromised overall survival in the USA.

Our findings highlight the imperative understanding of social ties and support surrounding children's families for planning strategies to prevent TxA."
Do intrinsic differences between males and females determine sex-specific consequences of inbreeding?,"These results suggest that females experience stronger selection on genes contributing to reproductive traits. Inbreeding depression in males may be further reduced by sex chromosome hemizygosity, which affects the dominance of some mutations, as well as by the absence of sexual selection. Determining the relative contributions of sex-specific expression, genes on the sex chromosomes, and the environment they are filtered through-including opportunities for sexual selection-may explain the frequent though inconsistent records of sex differences in inbreeding depression, along with their implications for conservation and the evolution of mating systems."
Is incidental findings of uncertain significance : To know or not to know -- that the question?,"This article investigates how the various arguments for and against a right not to know hold for IFUS. The main investigated arguments are: hypothetical utilitarianism, the right-based argument, the feasibility argument, the value of knowledge argument, the argument from lost significance, the empirical argument, the duty to disclose argument, the avoiding harm argument; the argument from principle, from autonomy, from privacy, as well as the argument from the right to an open future. The analysis shows that both sides in the debate have exaggerated the importance of incidental findings. Opponents of a right not to know have exaggerated the importance of IFUS, while proponents have exaggerated the need to be protected from something that is not knowledge. Hence, to know or not to know is not the question. The question is whether we should be able to stay ignorant of incidental findings of uncertain significance, if we want to. The answer is yes: As long as the information is not accurate and/or actionable: ignorance is bliss. When answering questions that are not asked, we need to think twice."

This may reflect heterogeneity between the populations, a smaller effect size than originally predicted, or possibly a false-positive result in the original study. Further fine mapping studies of the TNF promoter region and studies assessing functional consequences of TNF promoter polymorphisms are now required in IBD."
Is empathetic perspective-taking impaired in schizophrenia : evidence from a study of emotion attribution and theory of mind?,"Schizophrenia patients, unlike autistic individuals, suffer a domain-general difficulty with empathetic perspective-taking that affects equally their appreciation of other people's beliefs, percepts, and emotions."
Is it highly unlikely that the development of an abdominal wall hernia can be attributable to a single strenuous event?,"We conclude that we are unable to find any clinical evidence to support the hypothesis that a hernia might develop as the result of one single strenuous or traumatic event. While we accept that this mechanism might still possibly occur, we believe that, at best, it is extremely uncommon. If a medical expert is preparing a report on such a case in a claim for personal injury, then they have a duty to the court to examine carefully all the contemporaneous medical records. If no clinical evidence exists to support the claim, then they have a duty to the court not to support the plaintiff's claim."

Do iCF and ICD codes provide a standard language of disability in young children?,The results demonstrate that ICD and ICF can be jointly used as a common language to document disability characteristics of children in early intervention.
Does the Tardieu Scale differentiate contracture from spasticity whereas the Ashworth Scale is confounded by it?,"In all cases that spasticity was overestimated by the Ashworth Scale, participants had a contracture. These findings suggest that the Tardieu Scale differentiates spasticity from contracture whereas the Ashworth Scale is confounded by it."
Does cardiovascular system in larval zebrafish respond to developmental hypoxia in a family specific manner?,Zebrafish families vary in their plastic response to hypoxia. Genetic variation in plastic response to hypoxia may therefore provide the basic ingredient for adaptation to a variable environment. Considerable variation in the degree of familial response to hypoxia exists between different cardiovascular traits that may contribute to cardiac output. It is possible that the integration of several subsidiary traits into cardiac output allows the maintenance of genetic variance in cardiac response.
Does perineural invasion on prostate needle biopsy predict biochemical failure following brachytherapy for prostate cancer?,Perineural invasion is not a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence in patients undergoing brachytherapy for prostate cancer.
Is hepatitis B virus replication regulated by the acetylation status of hepatitis B virus cccDNA-bound H3 and H4 histones?,"We developed a ChIP-based assay to analyze, in vitro and ex vivo, the transcriptional regulation of HBV cccDNA minichromosome. Our results provide new insights on the regulation of HBV replication and identify the enzymatic activities that modulate the acetylation of cccDNA-bound histones as new therapeutic targets for anti-HBV drugs."
Is one fracture enough ! Experience with a prospective and consecutive osteoporosis screening program with 239 fracture patients?,"Screening of fracture patients who visit an orthopedics department appears to be an effective way of identifying individuals with low bone mineral density. The screening routines can be organized as an osteoporosis team consisting of a doctor, a nurse and a secretary at each department. Today, these patients are largely undetected and untreated--at least in our region. In our series, only 13 patients had been DEXA-scanned and were treated by antiresorptive drugs at the time of fracture."
Does autonomic response to standardized stress predict subsequent disease activity in ulcerative colitis?,An atypical pattern of autonomic reactivity may be a marker of individual differences in stress regulation that has prognostic significance in ulcerative colitis.
Is repeat hepatic resection for recurrent colorectal liver metastases associated with favourable long-term survival?,The beneficial outcomes observed after repeat liver resection in selected patients with RCLM confirm the experience of others and support its status as the preferred choice of treatment for such patients.
Is evidence-based medicine affordable : the cost-effectiveness of current compared with optimal treatment in rheumatoid and osteoarthritis?,"While the precise dollar costs in each country will differ, the relativities at this level of coverage should remain the same. There is no evidence that closing the gap between evidence and practice would result in a drop in efficiency."
Do bone marrow diffusion measures correlate with dementia severity in HIV patients?,The results of this investigation support the utility of diffusion strategies for monitoring the marrow and provide further evidence of a relationship between marrow status changes and neurologic progression in HIV patients.
Do gender and race/ethnicity affect the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening?,Screening is most cost-effective in black men because of high age-specific colorectal cancer incidence rates. Initiation of colorectal cancer screening in this high-risk group prior to age 50 should be strongly considered.
Are sleep disorders long-term sequelae of both bacterial and viral meningitis?,"Impaired sleep is a long-term consequence of meningitis. Additional, so far undetermined, factors other than the severity of concomitant neurological deficits are responsible for the development of this sequela."
Are polymorphisms of estrogen receptor beta gene associated with hypospadias?,Our results suggest that variations in the ESR2 might influence susceptibility to hypospadias.
Does continuous positive airway pressure therapy lower vagal tone in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome?,The indices that reflect parasympathetic activity are increased during the night in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. CPAP treatment reduces the night time vagal indices of HRV to resemble those of normal controls. The reduction of parasympathetic activity may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the alleviation of bradyarrhythmic episodes following the initiation of CPAP therapy.
Is the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index inversely associated with serum carotenoids in non-diabetic subjects?,The serum antioxidant carotenoids were inversely associated with HOMA-estimated insulin resistance in non-diabetic subjects.
Is a G1103R mutation in CRB1 co-inherited with high hyperopia and Leber congenital amaurosis?,"Although hyperopia has been associated with LCA, it is typically moderate and variable between patients with the same mutation. In addition, some CRB1 mutations can be associated with either RP or LCA. We have shown that hyperopia and LCA are linked to the mutant CRB1 gene itself and are not dependent on unlinked modifiers."
Does tumor transcriptome reveal the predictive and prognostic impact of lysosomal protease inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer?,"This provides the first comprehensive molecular characterization of clinical responsiveness to PBC in NSCLC and reveals the predictive and prognostic impact of two lysosomal protease inhibitors, potentially representing novel targets for NSCLC therapeutics."
Does expression profile-defined classification of lung adenocarcinoma show close relationship with underlying major genetic changes and clinicopathologic behaviors?,"This study has shed light on heterogeneity in lung cancers, especially in adenocarcinomas, by establishing a molecularly, genetically, and clinically relevant, expression profile-defined classification. Future studies using independent patient cohorts are warranted to confirm the prognostic significance of EGFR mutations in TRU-type adenocarcinoma."
Do cLLU1 expression levels predict time to initiation of therapy and overall survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,CLLU1 is the first identified CLL specific gene. The CLLU1 mRNA expression level can predict time to initiation of treatment and survival in CLL patients.
"Are vKORC1 haplotypes associated with arterial vascular diseases ( stroke , coronary heart disease , and aortic dissection )?","The haplotype of VKORC1 may serve as a novel genetic marker for the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, and aortic dissection."
Is adiponectin in umbilical cord blood inversely related to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but not ethnicity?,"This is the first report of an inverse relationship between cord adiponectin and LDL-C at birth. In contrast to adult studies, we found no significant association between adiponectin and HDL-C in cord blood. Our results and the strong independent association between adiponectin and HDL-C observed in adult studies suggest a role for adiponectin in lipid metabolism. Ethnic differences in adiponectin may arise after birth."
Do [ Analysis of recurrence and prognosis after surgical resection for I stage lower rectal carcinoma ]?,Radical resection of I stage lower rectal carcinoma has low recurrence rate and better prognosis. Sphincter preserving operation and local excision must be strictly selected in proper patients.
Is the programmable adult Codman Hakim valve useful even in very small children with hydrocephalus . A 7-year retrospective study with special focus on cost/benefit analysis?,"The programmable valve was easy to handle; only one size was required and the adjustment made it possible to achieve an optimal intraventricular pressure with a lower total cost, reduced hospital stay as well as an increased quality of life for the children."
Are smaller cerebellar volumes in very preterm infants at term-equivalent age associated with the presence of supratentorial lesions?,"Premature infants at term-equivalent age have similar total cerebellar and vermal volumes compared with term infants in the presence of normal brain imaging. Reduced cerebellar volume in preterm infants at term-equivalent age is seen in association with supratentorial pathology such as hemorrhagic parenchymal infarction, intraventricular hemorrhage with dilation, and periventricular leukomalacia."
Does abeta42 gene vaccination reduce brain amyloid plaque burden in transgenic mice?,We have developed a gene gun mediated Abeta42 gene vaccination method that is efficient to break host Abeta42 tolerance without using adjuvant and induces a Th2 immune response. Abeta42 gene vaccination significantly reduces the Abeta42 burden of the brain in treated APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic mice with no overlap between treated and control mice.
Do admission serum lactate levels predict mortality in the acutely injured patient?,This large retrospective examination of admission lactate levels failed to show useful predictive accuracy for hospital death. Serum lactate levels need not be obtained routinely but can be reserved for patients who will be admitted to the intensive care unit and/or require an emergency operation.
Is antibiotic treatment effective in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori suffering from extragastric MALT lymphoma?,"In our series, HP-eradication was ineffective for treatment of extragastric MALT lymphomas. This finding, along with an infection rate of 45%-as could also be expected in the general Austrian population-suggests that HP does not play a role in the development of these lymphomas. Antibiotic treatment targeting HP should, therefore, be discouraged in patients with extragastric MALT lymphomas."
Is hypoxia-induced resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin in non-small cell lung cancer inhibited by silencing of HIF-1alpha gene?,Our studies demonstrated that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin in NSCLC cells is through the HIF pathway. MDR1 regulation may not be involved in hypoxia-induced chemoresistance. Combining delivery of HIF-1alpha RNAi lentiviral vector with cisplatin-related chemotherapy regimens may enable us to develop more effective strategy for NSCLC therapy.
Does fDG-PET status following chemoradiotherapy provide high management impact and powerful prognostic stratification in oesophageal cancer?,"The use of post-treatment FDG-PET for assessment of tumour response after CRT changed the clinical management of more than one-third of OC patients. CMR status as assessed by PET powerfully stratified prognosis. Even in the absence of a baseline study, normalisation of uptake at all sites of known tumoral involvement carries a good medium-term prognosis."
Does fMRI show atypical language lateralization in pediatric epilepsy patients?,This study shows that epilepsy during childhood is associated with neuroplasticity and reorganization of language function.
Does peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma in colonic epithelial cells protect against experimental inflammatory bowel disease?,These studies reveal that PPARgamma expressed in the colonic epithelium has an endogenous role in protection against DSS induced colitis and that rosiglitazone may act through a PPARgamma independent pathway to suppress inflammation.
Does a systematic review identify a lack of standardization in methods for handling missing variance data?,"This work aggregates the ideas of many investigators. The abundance of methods suggests a lack of consistency within the systematic review community. Appropriate use of methods is sometimes suspect; consulting a statistician, early in the review process, is recommended. Further work is required to optimize method choice to alleviate any potential for bias and improve accuracy. Improved reporting is also encouraged."
Does the key to improving prognosis for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage remain in the pre-hospitalization period?,There remains much room for an improvement of prognosis for aSAH by early admission. We need to fully realize this reality and to directly face this problem.
Does sucrose concentration influence the rate of human oocytes with normal spindle and chromosome configurations after slow-cooling cryopreservation?,"Partial disruption of the MII spindle and associated chromosomes accompanies inadequate cryopreservation during slow cooling. However, protocols adopting higher sucrose concentration in the freezing solution promote the retention of an intact chromosome segregation apparatus comparable in incidence to freshly collected oocytes."
Does tumor size improve the accuracy of TNM predictions in patients with renal cancer?,"Tumor size represents a highly significant, multivariate, and informative predictor of RC outcomes and may warrant inclusion in future TNM revisions."
Are the catechol O-methyltransferase Val158Met polymorphism and herpes simplex virus type 1 infection risk factors for cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder : additive gene-environmental effects in a complex human psychiatric disorder?,Both the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and serological evidence of HSV-1 infection affect cognitive functioning in individuals with bipolar disorder.
Does non-invasive Mechanical Ventilation enhance Patient Autonomy in Decision-Making Regarding Chronic Ventilation?,"Non-invasive ventilation may be used in patients with profound muscle weakness, as a means of enhancing patient autonomy by improving communication and maintaining ventilation until decisions about ongoing care are made."
Are stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson 's disease : cognitive and affective changes linked to the motor outcome?,"Correct screening of patients for STN DBS remains an important issue, since the current implantation procedure is not able to take account of potential functional heterogeneity within the target."
"Is drug expectancy necessary for stimulus control of human attention , instrumental drug-seeking behaviour and subjective pleasure?","Drug-paired stimuli control selective attention, instrumental drug-seeking behaviour and positive emotional state by eliciting an explicit expectation of drug availability."
Are changes in maternal marital status associated with young adults ' cannabis use : evidence from a 21-year follow-up of a birth cohort?,Experience of changes in maternal marital status in mid- to late-childhood is a significant predictor of subsequent and early use of cannabis by the child. This holds true even after allowing for certain possible causes and consequences of marital breakdown.
Is routine repeat head CT for minimal head injury unnecessary?,RRHCT is unnecessary in patients with MHI. Clinical examination identifies accurately the few who will show significant evolution and require intervention.
Does a retrospective analysis of the impact of 18F-FDG PET scan on clinical management of 133 breast cancer patients?,PET holds promise as a sensitive and specific modality in following treated breast cancer patients. PET results contain information on 6 month outcome that is independent of stage or past treatment and influence patient management.
Is the imaginary line method reliable for identification of prosthetic heart valves on AP chest radiographs?,"The well known imaginary line method is of limited value when identifying prosthetic valve positions on supine AP CXR's. We advocate the use of the ""valve orifice"" method or the ""perceived direction of blood flow"" method to gain valuable information regarding the presence and position of prosthetic heart valves."
Are soap operas and talk shows on television associated with poorer cognition in older women?,Clinical interviews can incorporate questions about television viewing habits. Endorsements of talk shows or soap operas as frequent and favored television programming may identify those at risk for cognitive impairment and targets for further cognitive screening.
Is seizure outcome after resection of cavernous malformations better when surrounding hemosiderin-stained brain also is removed?,Our study suggests that complete removal of cavernoma-surrounding hemosiderin-stained brain tissue may improve epileptic outcome after resection of cavernous malformations.
Does integrin alpha2beta1 regulate neutrophil recruitment and inflammatory activity in experimental colitis in mice?,We demonstrate an alleviating action of the collagen-binding alpha2beta1 integrin in experimental colitis in mice and suggest that this effect is mediated by inhibition of neutrophil migration and activation. Local administration of function-blocking antibodies against integrin alpha2beta1 may provide novel avenues to treat inflammatory bowel disease.
Are c-reactive protein and homocysteine associated with dietary and behavioral risk factors for age-related macular degeneration?,C-reactive protein and HCY levels are related to traditional dietary and behavioral factors associated with age-related macular degeneration.
Does the distance-saturation product predict mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"Each component of the 6-min walk independently predicted mortality in IPF with greater accuracy than spirometry. However, a composite of both parameters, the DSP, provides slightly greater accuracy and represents a novel measure for assessing survival in patients with IPF."
Do demographic factors influence cognitive recovery after shunt for normal-pressure hydrocephalus?,"One third of patients met our definition of good cognitive improvement: improvement by at least 25% on at least half of the cognitive tests administered. There was a significant negative linear relationship between age and probability of good cognitive improvement. Additionally, the degree of cognitive improvement was found to be greater in women than men (P = 0.002). Age was found to be a better predictor of improvement on memory tests, while sex was a better predictor of improvement on non-memory tests after shunt insertion."
Does genetic variation in 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 predict adrenal hyperandrogenism among lean women with polycystic ovary syndrome?,Genetic variation in 11beta-HSD1 contributes to enhanced cortisol clearance and compensatory adrenal hyperandrogenism in lean patients with PCOS but may be protective against obesity and some features of the metabolic syndrome.
Does vaccination with a HER2/neu peptide induce intra- and inter-antigenic epitope spreading in patients with early stage breast cancer?,Our data provide evidence for the induction of intra- and interantigenic epitope spreading that results from a single HER2/neu peptide vaccine even in early staged patients. The ability to raise immunity to multiple tumor antigens depends on both the degree of HER2/neu expression and the extent of disease. Epitope spreading is an essential element for the success of a peptide vaccine strategy.
Does scopolamine induce impairments in the recognition of human facial expressions of anger and disgust?,"Scopolamine-induced cholinergic hypofunction selectively impaired the recognition accuracy of disgust and anger facial expressions. The effects of scopolamine on emotion-recognition are similar to those found in Huntington's disease patients. Furthermore, the impairments in anger and fear recognition previously observed with diazepam do not appear to be a general property of benzodiazepines. This suggests that alterations in emotional processing involving changes in the ability to recognize threat-related emotions (particularly, fear and anger) may not be a principal mechanism underlying anxiolysis or paradoxical aggression seen with benzodiazepines."
Does family-based association analysis validate chromosome 3p21 as a putative nasopharyngeal carcinoma susceptibility locus?,"These results reflected a link disequilibrium between this chromosome region and a nasopharyngeal carcinoma susceptibility locus, and provided further evidence that a novel nasopharyngeal carcinoma susceptibility gene may be located in this chromosome region. These alleles or haplotypes transmitting disequilibrium in nasopharyngeal carcinoma pedigrees may act as the highly risk molecular markers after verified in large population."
Does positive family history promote participation in colorectal cancer screening?,"Positive family history seems to be a motivation factor for a participation in a CRC screening program. Consistent with previous studies the prevalence of CRA and CRC was significantly higher in the group of FDR compared to controls (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 20)."
Are select estrogens within the complex formulation of conjugated equine estrogens ( Premarin ) protective against neurodegenerative insults : implications for a composition of estrogen therapy to promote neuronal function and prevent Alzheimer 's disease?,"The present study provides the first documentation of the neuroprotective profile of individual estrogens contained within the complex formulation of CEE at concentrations commensurate with their plasma levels achieved after an oral administration of 0.625 mg CEE in women. Our analyses demonstrate that select estrogens within the complex formulation of CEE contribute to its neuroprotective efficacy. Moreover, our data predict that the magnitude of neuroprotection induced by individual estrogens at relatively low concentrations may be clinically undetectable and ineffective, whereas, a combination of select neuroprotective estrogens could provide an increased and clinically meaningful efficacy. More importantly, these data suggest a strategy for determining neurological efficacy and rational design and development of a composition of estrogen therapy to alleviate climacteric symptoms, promote neurological health, and prevent age-related neurodegeneration, such as AD, in postmenopausal women."
Does ankle brace effectively reduce recurrence of ankle sprains in female soccer players?,We suggest that prophylactic ankle bracing is effective in reducing the incidence of ankle sprains in female soccer players with a previous history of ankle sprains.
Is microsatellite instability in gastric cancer associated with better prognosis in only stage II cancers?,"Microsatellite analysis of gastric cancer has clinical utility in determination of prognosis, but should be determined in only stage II neoplasms in a routine clinical setting. Immunohistochemistry may be considered sufficient, although microsatellite analysis is preferable."
Does pentoxifylline prevent neither liver damage nor early profibrogenic events in a rat model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis?,PTX does influence neither liver injury nor early profibrogenic events in the CDD model of NASH.
"Is serum cystatin C a suitable marker for routine monitoring of renal function in pediatric cancer patients , especially of very young age?","CysC represents a suitable marker for monitoring renal function in pediatric cancer patients. In young children (<3 years), CysC may have a better diagnostic value than SCR. Future studies should show if CysC can improve renal monitoring by replacing SCR, especially in very young children."
Is the probability of pulmonary embolism a function of the diagnoses considered most likely before testing?,"The frequency of PE is related to the most likely pretest alternative diagnosis. PE is diagnosed infrequently when anxiety, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, musculoskeletal pain, or viral syndrome is the most likely alternative diagnosis."
Does the blood pressure-induced diameter response of retinal arterioles decrease with increasing diabetic maculopathy?,"The diameter response was reduced in type 2 diabetic patients with retinopathy, whereas retinal thickness was increased in patients with diabetic maculopathy. This suggests that impairment of diameter response in retinal arterioles precedes the development of diabetic macular edema."
Does mobilization of bone marrow stem cells by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ameliorate radiation-induced damage to salivary glands?,"The results show that BMCs home to damaged salivary glands after mobilization and induce repair processes, which improve function and morphology. This process does not involve transdifferentiation of BMCs to salivary gland cells. Mobilization of BMCs could become a promising modality to ameliorate radiation-induced complications after radiotherapy."
Does population-based mammography screening result in substantial savings in treatment costs for fatal breast cancer?,"Treatment costs for fatal breast cancer are high. Mammography screening results in substantial treatment cost savings, in which reduction of fatal disease is the key element."
Does surgery remove EEG abnormalities in patients with Chiari type I malformation and poor CSF flow?,"A new CNS symptom, identified as focal IRDA alone or focal IRDA plus spikes and spike waves of high voltage in the EEG, seems to be associated with poor CSF flow in 'apparently asymptomatic' patients with Chiari type I malformations."
Does treatment of tinnitus with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation improve patients ' quality of life?,Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is a useful method to improve the quality of life of patients with tinnitus.
Do neuroactive antiretroviral drugs influence neurocognitive performance in less advanced HIV-infected patients responding to highly active antiretroviral therapy?,"Our study indicates that the use of stable HAART, including multiple drugs that have good CSF penetration, was not associated with neuropsychologic performance. To prevent independent replication of HIV in CSF with better control of a relevant reservoir of HIV is one of the crucial aims of therapeutic strategy."
Does pediatric renal allograft transplantation normalize the increased cortisol/cortisone ratios of chronic renal failure?,In all children with chronic renal failure plasma and urinary cortisol/cortisone ratios are elevated and do not return to normal levels after renal allograft transplantation. This suggests that renal transplantation does not normalize 11beta-HSD2 activity.
Does post-operative unwashed shed blood transfusion modify the cellular immune response to surgery for total knee replacement?,"Post-operative salvage and return of USB after TKR does not seem to increase the post-operative infection rate or hospital stay, and does not modify CIR induced by surgery. These findings add to the clinical experience that post-operative USB return, as a source of autologous blood, is safe, and questions the beneficial effect of blood washing."
Does metabolic syndrome predict mobility decline in a community-based sample of older adults?,These findings suggest that metabolic syndrome may be a distinct risk factor for mobility decline in community-dwelling older people.
Do long-term heavy marijuana users make costly decisions on a gambling task?,"These data suggest that long-term heavy marijuana users may have specific deficits in the ability to balance rewards and punishments that may contribute to continued drug-taking behavior. It is unknown, however, whether the basis for such deficits might be attributed directly to marijuana exposure or pre-existing genetic or behavioral differences."
Is prostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) a tissue-specific target for adenoviral transduction of prostate cancer in vitro?,PSMA serves as a tissue-specific target for adenoviral vectors and may be applicable for gene therapeutical treatment of prostate cancer.
Are static pressure-volume curve characteristics moderate estimators of optimal airway pressures in a mathematical model of ( primary/pulmonary ) acute respiratory distress syndrome?,"A recruitment maneuver followed by subsequent reduction in airway pressure limits end-expiratory atelectasis, overstretching, and pressure. None of the objective characteristics of the pressure-volume curve was predictive for end-expiratory atelectasis, overstretching, or optimal airway pressure."
Does the role of video technology in on-line lecture for the deaf?,"We can conclude that for deaf people it is extremely important to introduce the use of information and communications technology on all levels of education and rehabilitation. This increases their ability to learn and improves their understanding of learning materials, especially if the applications are designed specifically for their needs. Through daily exposure to a larger number of such materials, we can positively influence the literacy (reading and writing skills) of the deaf. With increased literacy, the deaf would be able to read literature, and subtitles, enabling them to receive information through written sources. Therefore, we can expect them to have a higher self-esteem, more easily integrate into society and have more opportunities for employment."
Does fast-tracking ( bypassing the PACU ) reduce nursing workload after ambulatory surgery?,"Bypassing the PACU after these short outpatient procedures significantly decreases recovery time without compromising patient satisfaction. However, the overall nursing workload and the associated cost were not significantly affected."
Do uremic toxins adsorbed by AST-120 promote tubular hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis in nephrectomized rats?,"Administration of AST-120 minimized the appearance of proximal tubular hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, and subsequently prevented the occurrence of proteinuria and decreased renal function. The present study indicates that uremic toxins adsorbed by AST-120 promote tubular hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis in nephrectomized rats."
Is migraine associated with magnetic resonance imaging white matter abnormalities : a meta-analysis?,This meta-analysis demonstrates that subjects with migraine are at higher risk of having WMAs on magnetic resonance images than those without migraine. This increased risk is present even in younger individuals who do not have co-occurring cerebrovascular disease risk factors. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether the increased risk of stroke in migraine is mediated or foreshadowed by the presence of WMAs.
Is hippocampal and prefrontal atrophy in patients with early non-demented Parkinson 's disease related to cognitive impairment?,"Non-medicated, non-demented patients with early stage PD show hippocampal and prefrontal atrophy. Impaired memory is related to hippocampal atrophy, whereas sustained attention is related to prefrontal atrophy."
Do professionalism deficiencies in a first-quarter doctor-patient relationship course predict poor clinical performance in medical school?,Professionalism deficiencies that result in the inability of the student to establish patient rapport are detectable early and predict problems in future clinical performance.
Does local lymph node involvement predict poor outcome in pediatric renal cell carcinoma?,"Children with lymph node-positive RCC in the absence of distant metastatic disease had a relatively favorable long-term prognosis, with survival rate nearly triple those of adult historical controls. Until highly effective therapies for RCC are identified, these children should not be exposed to adjuvant treatment. Further investigation of the biologic differences between adult and pediatric RCC is warranted."
Does virgin olive oil reduce blood pressure in hypertensive elderly subjects?,"Dietary VOO proved to be helpful in reducing the systolic pressure of treated HT elderly subjects. However, a greater resistance to the lowering effect of VOO of total and LDL-cholesterol and a greater susceptibility to TG oxidation was detected in these patients."
Are plasma levels of amyloid beta-protein 42 increased in women with mild cognitive impairment?,The elevation of Abeta42 plasma levels in women with MCI may represent a biologic explanation for the sex-dependent increased incidence of late-onset AD in women identified by epidemiologic studies.
Is the VAD-DCEP sequence an effective pre-transplant therapy in untreated multiple myeloma?,"the VAD-DCEP sequence has an adequate mobilizing capacity, without significant toxicity, and a good anti-myeloma activity, and therefore represents a safe and effective therapeutic approach for multiple myeloma patients at the onset of their disease."
Does diosgenin induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human leukemia K562 cells with the disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis?,"Diosgenin inhibits K562 cell proliferation via cell cycle G2/M arrest and apoptosis, with disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction playing vital roles."
Does cerebellar stroke impair temporal but not spatial accuracy during implicit motor learning?,"During implicit motor learning, the cerebellum appears to participate in the formation of predictive strategies for the timing of motor responses, rather than for the accuracy of motor execution. Because deficits were found in the contralesional upper extremity, the authors suggest that this function is not lateralized to 1 hemisphere; cerebellar output may affect the formation of an internal model for timing movements in both upper extremities."
Does implicit strategy affect learning in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure?,"The finding of spared retention of verbal information on the CVLT-C in our earlier studies may be related to test characteristics of the CVLT-C rather than a finding of spared verbal retention per se, given that spared retention was not found on a separate test of verbal learning and memory without an implicit learning strategy. These results suggest that the use of an implicit strategy positively affected the ability of alcohol-exposed children to learn and retain new verbal information."
Is type D personality associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and their partners?,"Partners experienced similar levels of depression but higher levels of anxiety compared with ICD patients. Personality was an important explanatory factor of distress in both ICD patients and their partners. Research is now warranted to investigate the implications of this finding for the clinical course of ICD patients, as Type D personality has been associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease."
Is c-reactive protein associated with psychological risk factors of cardiovascular disease in apparently healthy adults?,"Greater anger and severity of depressive symptoms, separately and in combination with hostility, were significantly associated with elevations in CRP in apparently healthy men and women. These associations were independent of potential confounding factors."
Does a polymorphic variation in the interleukin 1A gene increase brain microglial cell activity in Alzheimer 's disease?,"Polymorphisms within IL-1A influence the degree of brain microglial cell activation, especially in bearers of APOE epsilon4 allele, reinforcing the importance of neuroinflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of AD, and supporting the rationale for treating the disease with inflammation modulating drugs."
Is induction and function of CYR61 ( CCN1 ) in prostatic stromal and epithelial cells : CYR61 required for prostatic cell proliferation?,"In this study, we demonstrate that serum growth factors induce the CYR61 gene in both stromal and epithelial cells, and that CYR61 plays functional roles in cell adhesion, morphology, and proliferation, supporting its involvement in benign prostatic enlargement. These results strongly suggest that CYR61 is a key molecule, and therefore could be a potential therapeutic target in prostatic hyperplastic growth."
Does right prosubiculum amyloid plaque density correlate with anosognosia in Alzheimer 's disease?,Increased SP density in the right PRO region suggests that selective pathological involvement of this area contributes to awareness deficits in Alzheimer's disease. The putative role of the PRO in self appraisal may reflect its interconnections with other medial temporal and prefrontal regions.
Does the combination oral and nutritional treatment of late-onset diabetes mellitus ( CONTROL DM ) trial result?,Brachial artery endothelial function was not influenced by short-term improvements in glycaemic control. The CONTROL DM group was successful in lowering A1C. Future research should explore more intensive and longer-lasting improvements in glycaemic control on endothelial function. Some data previously published in abstract form (Diabetes 2001; 50 (Suppl. 2): A217).
Is follicular blood flow a better predictor of the outcome of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer than follicular fluid vascular endothelial growth factor and nitric oxide concentrations?,Our study showed that follicular blood flow was positively associated with the outcome of pregnancy. This is the first study to investigate the direct association of the follicular blood flow with pregnancy outcome after IVF-ET. These results suggest that follicular blood flow might be a more effective prognostic marker of the pregnancy outcome of IVF than follicular fluid VEGF or NO concentrations.
Is the placental immunomodulatory cytokine regeneration and tolerance factor also expressed by both human cycling and early pregnant endometrium?,These results indicate that RTF is constitutively expressed at endometrial and decidual level and its up-regulation during the secretory phase of the cycle may be relevant in mediating some immune-related aspects of uterine physiology.
Is overcommitment to work associated with changes in cardiac sympathetic regulation?,Overcommitment to work was associated with an increase in basal sympathetic drive and a reduction in the dynamic range of cardiac sympathetic regulation. Both findings are compatible with the hypothesis that overcommitment induces beta-receptor down-regulation.
Is dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) a useful modality for the precise detection and staging of early prostate cancer?,"DCE-MRI can identify early stage Cap with high sensitivity and specificity, and can predict the histological grade to some extent. DCE-MRI prior to biopsy should be applied to younger patients with surgical indications. Otherwise, we recommend the definitive diagnosis of Cap by utilizing DCE-MRI alone."
Does the influence of age on prognosis of de novo acute myeloid leukemia differ according to cytogenetic subgroups?,"(i) Both age and cytogenetics are independent prognostic parameters in AML;(ii) up to the age of 49 years age has no major impact on prognosis while the karyotype has; (iii) in patients 50 years and older the influence of age on outcome increases, and (iv) cytogenetics show an independent effect on survival also in patients over 60 years old."
Are hIV-infected US youth at high risk of obesity and poor diet quality : a challenge for improving short- and long-term health outcomes?,"Obesity is a common nutrition problem for both HIV-infected and uninfected youth; however, HIV-infected youth are at increased risk of developing metabolic abnormalities. Culturally appropriate, client-focused nutrition education will help youth improve their diet and increase physical activity to reduce health consequences associated with both obesity and HIV infection."
"Is histologic grade , but not SYT-SSX fusion type , an important prognostic factor in patients with synovial sarcoma : a multicenter , retrospective analysis?","For patients with localized SS, histologic grade but not SYT-SSX fusion type is a strong predictor of survival."
Are intact progesterone receptors essential to counteract the proliferative effect of estradiol in a genetically engineered mouse model of endometriosis?,"Intact PR in ectopic uterine tissue is essential to abolish E(2)-dependent or -independent proliferation. We also suggest that ectopic uterine tissue is associated with significantly increased resistance to P action and increased predisposition to E(2)-dependent proliferation in the absence of PR. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that P resistance in human endometriosis may be due to the absence of sufficient levels of functional PR in this tissue."
Does endobronchial ultrasonography using a guide sheath increase the ability to diagnose peripheral pulmonary lesions endoscopically?,"EBUS-GS is a useful method for collecting samples from peripheral pulmonary lesions, even those too small to be visualized under fluoroscopy."
Are uK patients with primary Sjögren 's syndrome at increased risk from clinical depression?,Patients with 1 degrees SS appear to be at increased risk from clinical depression. Early recognition and appropriate intervention is therefore essential to reduce the negative impact of depression on the patient's quality of life and outcome of their disease.
Does clinical pathway care improve outcomes among patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia?,Patients who were placed on pneumonia clinical pathway care were much more likely than non-pathway patients to have favorable outcomes of care.
Does autocrine over expression of fibronectin by human transitional carcinoma cells impair bacillus Calmette-Guerin adherence and signaling?,We propose that by saturating cellular and BCG receptors excess FN expression decreases the ability of cellular or mycobacterial bound FN to bind vacant receptors on BCG or on the cell. Excess FN inhibits BCG adherence and BCG initiated signal transduction.
Do prostate cancer detection on urinalysis for alpha methylacyl coenzyme a racemase protein?,"We report the feasibility of a novel, noninvasive, nonprostate specific antigen based molecular approach to detect prostate cancer in voided urine. To our knowledge this is the first report of AMACR protein detection in the urine of patients with prostate cancer. A screening test based on urinary AMACR may develop into a useful adjunct to serum prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination for identifying men at increased risk for harboring prostate cancer despite negative biopsy. Such a test has potential application for stratifying patients into low and high risk groups for surveillance vs repeat biopsy."
Do androgen receptor levels in prostate cancer epithelial and peritumoral stromal cells identify non-organ confined disease?,"These findings suggest that AR is an important determinant of disease relapse in early stage prostate cancer, and that altered AR levels in the malignant epithelial cells or in the peritumoral stroma is indicative of non-organ confined prostate cancer."
Does psychological support counselling improve gluten-free diet compliance in coeliac patients with affective disorders?,In coeliac disease patients with affective disorders psychological support seems to be able to reduce depression and to increase gluten-free diet compliance.
Is ability to perform activities of daily living the main factor affecting quality of life in patients with dementia?,Dependency upon others to perform ADL was the main factor affecting HRQoL.
Do activation of Erk and JNK MAPK pathways by acute swim stress in rat brain regions?,"Swim stress specifically and markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of the MAPKKs P-MEK1/2 and P-MKK4 in all brain regions tested without apparent alteration in the phosphorylation of P-MKK3/6. Curiously, phosphorylation of their cognate substrates (Erk and JNK) was increased to a much more modest extent, and in some brain regions was not altered. Similarly, there was a region-specific discrepancy between Erk and CREB phosphorylation. Possible explanations for these findings and comparison with the effects of restraint stress will be discussed."
Does restoration of fibroblast growth factor receptor2 suppress growth and tumorigenicity of malignant human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells?,"The results indicate that restoration of FGFR2IIIb to the malignant human prostate epithelial cell prototype PC-3 restores properties associated with nonmalignant tumors and normal cells. This further suggests that epithelial cell resident, homeostasis-promoting FGFR2 may be involved in suppression of malignancy and that restoration may be a candidate for gene therapy of hormone-refractory prostate cancer."
Are thoracic epidural local anesthetics ineffective in alleviating post-thoracotomy ipsilateral shoulder pain?,"It is concluded that post-thoracotomy shoulder pain is a common problem, and the previously mentioned variables did not predict its appearance. Thoracic epidural block is effective in the treatment of incision but not shoulder pain. The NSAID indomethacin suppository was found to be effective for that problem."
Do cARD15/NOD2 single nucleotide polymorphisms confer susceptibility to type I psoriasis?,The most complete assessment of CARD15 SNPs in type I psoriasis to date reveals no evidence of association to type I psoriasis.
Are structural abnormalities similar in familial and nonfamilial mesial temporal lobe epilepsy?,"Anterior temporal lobe atrophy and other abnormalities outside the mesial portion of temporal lobes were infrequent in both familial and nonfamilial MTLE patients. Despite the genetic basis, hippocampal atrophy in FMTLE is not associated with other abnormalities outside the mesial temporal regions."
Are tAU mutations a predominant cause of frontotemporal dementia in Canadian patients?,Our results agree with previous work suggesting that mutations in this gene are not a frequent cause of the frontotemporal dementia phenotype in Canadian patients.
Is survivin an independent prognostic marker for risk stratification of breast cancer patients?,"Survivin demonstrates a strong, independent, association with poor prognosis. Survivin might be used as a new marker to stratify breast cancer patients for more optimal treatment modalities, or it could be a promising new target for therapy."
Is 2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography imaging predictive of pathologic response and survival after preoperative chemoradiation in patients with esophageal carcinoma?,Post-CRT FDG-PET was found to be predictive of pathologic response and survival in patients with esophageal carcinoma who undergo preoperative CRT. Esophagectomy should still be considered even if the post-CRT FDG-PET scan is normal because microscopic residual disease cannot be ruled out.
Is activator protein 1 DNA binding activity decreased in lesional psoriatic skin compared with nonlesional psoriatic skin?,"Together, these results suggest that the activity of the transcription factor AP-1 is impaired in lesional psoriatic skin and that this impairment may be important for the disturbed epidermal growth observed in psoriasis."
Is polymorphism within the glutathione S-transferase P1 gene associated with increased susceptibility to childhood malignant diseases?,Our results support the hypothesis that GST genotype affects etiology and outcome of a variety of childhood malignancies.
Is evidence-based care for alcohol use disorders affordable?,"Evidence-based care for alcohol use disorders would produce greater population health gain at an increased cost for alcohol dependence but at a reduced cost for harmful use of alcohol. For both disorders, there are substantial increases in cost-effectiveness."
Does cDNA array-CGH profiling identify genomic alterations specific to stage and MYCN-amplification in neuroblastoma?,cDNA A-CGH analysis is an efficient method for the detection and characterization of amplicons. Furthermore we were able to detect single copy number changes using our probabilistic approach and identified genomic alterations specific to stage and MYCN amplification.
Does voxel-based morphometry reveal gray matter network atrophy in refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy?,"Patients with MTLE exhibit a reduction in GMC in regions outside the temporal lobe, specifically in areas that are connected to the hippocampus and parahippocampal region, suggesting an anatomical route for atrophy."
Do another look at heavy episodic drinking and alcohol use disorders among college and noncollege youth?,Heavy episodic drinking and alcohol use disorders are youth as well as college phenomena. Prevention campaigns targeted at all youth are needed to supplement interventions conducted at the campus level.
Does psychosocial and lifestyle correlate of premenstrual symptoms among military women?,"Work stress may mediate the relationship among depression and premenstrual symptoms. Further research is needed to elucidate the biological interrelationships among work stress, hormonal function, and premenstrual symptomatology."
Are oestrogen deficiency and growth hormone treatment in childhood associated with hearing in adults with turner syndrome?,"Current regimens of oestrogen and GH therapy have no impact on adult hearing loss in TS, independent of age. The prevalence of SNHL increases with age. CHL but not SNHL is associated with ENT history and karyotype. According to present evidence, the only possible intervention to reduce hearing loss in women with TS remains assiduous treatment of ENT problems in childhood."
Is bladder neck invasion an independent predictor of prostate-specific antigen recurrence?,"In the current study, bladder neck involvement was an independent predictor of early PSA recurrence. The data demonstrated the importance of continued assessment of bladder neck invasion and supported the placement of tumors with bladder neck involvement in a stage that recognizes the prognostic implications of such involvement."
Is regulation of glucose transporter expression in cardiac myocytes : p38 MAPK a strong inducer of GLUT4?,"Spontaneous dedifferentiation of adult rat cardiomyocytes in vitro is associated with downregulation of GLUT4, which can be reversed by treatment with IGF-1. The effect of IGF-1 is mediated by the p38 MAPK/MEF2 axis, which is a strong inducer of GLUT4 expression."
Does procedure for unmasking localization information from ProstaScint scan for prostate radiation therapy treatment planning?,"ProstaScint images are now closer to becoming a biologically and therapeutically useful and accurate image set. After known sources of normal intensity are stripped away, the remaining areas that demonstrate uptake may be segmented and superimposed on the treatment-planning CT/MRI volume."
Does n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation decrease asymmetric dimethyl arginine and arachidonate accumulation in aging spontaneously hypertensive rats?,EPA and DHA supplementation reduced ADMA accumulation in SHR in parallel with a decrease of arachidonate availability. This finding suggests that the control of the inflammatory ground of endothelium might play an important role in EPA and DHA effect on this novel and highly predictive cardiovascular risk factor.
Does ambulatory monitoring predict development of drug-treated hypertension in subjects with high normal blood pressure?,We conclude that ABPM correctly predicts development of drug-treated hypertension in most subjects who were identified early as having a daytime mean ABP >135/85 mmHg. ABPM appears to be a useful clinical tool in the early diagnosis of hypertension in subjects with metabolic risk factors and smoking.
Does oral Polypodium leucotomos extract decrease ultraviolet-induced damage of human skin?,Oral administration of PL is an effective systemic chemophotoprotective agent leading to significant protection of skin against UV radiation.
Do low levels of estrogen receptor beta protein predict resistance to tamoxifen therapy in breast cancer?,"These findings provide evidence that ER-beta may be an independent predictor of response to tamoxifen in breast cancer. Furthermore, these results suggest that ER-beta may influence tumor progression in ways different from those mediated by the ER-alpha isoform."
Does association of cholesterol with stroke risk vary in stroke subtypes and patient subgroups?,"Higher total and lower HDL cholesterol levels were associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, especially certain stroke subtypes and patient subgroups. The lowest levels of total cholesterol were associated with an increased risk of all hemorrhagic strokes."
Does optical coherence tomography detect characteristic retinal nerve fiber layer thickness corresponding to band atrophy of the optic discs?,The degree of RNFL thickness reduction correlated with that of visual field defects. Optical coherence tomography was able to identify the characteristic pattern of RNFL loss in these eyes.
Are markers of inflammation in patients with coronary artery disease also associated with glycosylated haemoglobin A1c within the normal range?,"In subjects with known coronary atherosclerosis, low-degree inflammatory activity is not only increased in diabetic patients, but also increased with increasing HbA(1c) in non-diabetic individuals with HbA(1c) within the normal range, i.e., at a pre-diabetic level of glucose metabolism derangement."
Is sMAC expressed de novo in a subset of cervical cancer tumors?,"Smac is expressed de novo in a subset of cervical cancer patients, reflecting a possible heterogeneity in the pathways leading to cervical cancer. There was no correlation with any clinical variable."
Is vasopressin administered with epinephrine associated with a return of a pulse in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest?,There is an association between using vasopressin in combination with epinephrine and restoration of circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
Does two-year statin therapy alter the progression of intima-media thickness in patients with type 2 diabetes without manifest cardiovascular disease?,"There was no effect of 2 years' statin therapy on carotid IMT in type 2 diabetic subjects. The natural history of IMT in our patients was milder than anticipated. In contrast, we observed a significantly lower cardiovascular event rate on statin therapy. Prognostic tools other than IMT should be explored in this patient group."
Is heat shock protein-27 upregulated in the temporal cortex of patients with epilepsy?,"These results demonstrate that HSP-27 becomes induced in response to epileptic pathology. Although the functional aspects of HSP-27 induction during human epilepsy have yet to be elucidated, it can be concluded that HSP-27 is a marker for cortical regions in which a stress response has been caused by seizures."
Is igG4-subclass of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody more frequent in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults than in type 1 diabetes?,"The difference in GADA IgG-subclasses could indicate a different immune response, possibly an altered balance between T(h)1 and T(h)2 cytokine profile in pancreatic islets. This difference could contribute to the slower rate of beta cell destruction in LADA patients, as reflected by a higher C-peptide level at clinical onset."
Does innate immune system play a critical role in determining the progression and severity of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity?,"NK and NKT cells play a critical role in the progression of APAP-induced liver injury by secreting IFN-gamma, modulating chemokine production and accumulation of neutrophils, and up-regulating FasL expression in the liver, all of which may promote the inflammatory response of liver innate immune system, thus contributing to the severity and progression of liver injury downstream of the metabolism of APAP and depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) in hepatocytes."
"Are matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , MMP-2 , and serum elastase activity associated with systolic hypertension and arterial stiffness?","Aortic stiffness is related to MMP-9 levels and SEA, not only in ISH, but also in younger, apparently healthy individuals. This suggests that elastases including MMP-9 may be involved in the process of arterial stiffening and development of ISH. The relationship between arterial stiffness and elastase activity was examined in isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), and separately in a large cohort of healthy individuals. Aortic stiffness is related to MMP-9, not only in ISH, but also in healthy individuals, suggesting elastases may be involved in the process of arterial stiffening and the development of ISH."
Is cerebral oxygen desaturation associated with early postoperative neuropsychological dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery?,"Intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation is associated with early postoperative neuropsychological dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. However, it remains to be determined whether interventions to maintain adequate cerebral oxygenation may improve neuropsychological outcome."
Does [ Two-tier screening process ( TEOAE/AABR ) reduce recall rates in newborn hearing screening ]?,"A two-tier screening process as described is able to reduce recall rate, overall expenses and parental anxiety."
Does drugs and fall in older people in geriatric care settings?,"Like functional and cognitive impairment, treatments with antidepressants and neuroleptics are predisposing factors for falls in older people in residential care. However, there seem to be differences between subgroups among these drugs and, from the perspective of fall prevention, SNRIs rather than SSRIs should perhaps be preferred in the treatment of depression in older people."
Does aquaporin-4 gene disruption in mice protect against impaired retinal function and cell death after ischemia?,"AQP4 deletion in mice is neuroprotective in a transient ischemia model of retinal injury, suggesting the possible use of AQP4 inhibitors in retinal vascular occlusive and ischemic diseases."
Does coronary blood flow assessment after successful angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction predict the risk of long-term cardiac events?,"The CFV pattern appears to be an accurate predictor of long-term cardiac events in patients having undergone successful reopening of the IRA after AMI, identifying a subset of at-risk patients."
Do n100 auditory potential and electroencephalogram discriminate propofol-induced sedation levels?,"Our findings suggest that the combined use of EEG and N100 may help to differentiate the propofol-induced sedation levels, and thus be a useful compliment to clinical sedation scales."
Is increased tidal volume variability in children a better marker of opioid-induced respiratory depression than decreased respiratory rate?,TV(var) increases as children approach opioid-induced respiratory depression. This is a more useful predictor of respiratory depression than a fall in respiratory rate because the TV(var) increase is 10 times the drop in respiratory rate. A TV(var) increase also correctly predicts respiratory depression twice as often as decreased respiratory rate and is independent of age-related alterations in physiologic respiratory rates.
Do [ Construction and identification of anti-chymopapain scFv phage display library ]?,"Phage display library of anti-chymopapain scFv was successfully constructed, and scFv with binding ability to chymopapain was obtained."
Do hypotensive extremely low birth weight infants have reduced cerebral blood flow?,In ELBW infants (1) cerebral autoregulation is functional in normotensive but not hypotensive infants; (2) a breakpoint exists at approximately 30 mm Hg in the CBF-MAP autoregulation curve; and (3) dopamine improves both MAP and CBF.
Is immune reconstitution after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia most severely affected in the high risk group?,"This study shows that immune reconstitution after childhood ALL is slower than previously reported and emphasizes the influence of treatment intensity. The most intensively treated patients still have persistent abnormalities in T-, B-, and NK-cell subsets at 6 months post therapy and show a poor response to immunization with T-cell dependent antigens. In the HR group, routine re-immunizations before this time point are of limited benefit, and the effect of repeated vaccinations should be evaluated."
Does secondary ultrasound examination increase the sensitivity of the FAST exam in blunt trauma?,A secondary ultrasound of the abdomen significantly increases the sensitivity of ultrasound to detect intra-abdominal injury.
Does cXCL8 modulate human intestinal epithelial cells through a CXCR1 dependent pathway?,CXCL8 exerts functional effects on intestinal epithelial cells that may be relevant for intestinal inflammation and mucosal healing.
Are gadolinium contrast media more nephrotoxic than a low osmolar iodine medium employing doses with equal X-ray attenuation in renal arteriography : an experimental study in pigs?,"In pigs, 0.5 M Gd-CM were more nephrotoxic than both equal-attenuating (70 mg I/mL) and equimolar (190 mg I/mL) concentrations of the I-CM iohexol. These results do not support the ""off-label"" use of Gd-CM for renal x-ray arteriography in man instead of commercially available concentrations of iodine contrast media at 140, 150 and 180 mg I/mL or diluted to 70 mg I/mL."
Does gene expression profiling reveal novel TGFbeta targets in adult lung fibroblasts?,"This study identifies several novel TGFbeta targets in lung fibroblasts, and confirms with independent methods the induction of angiotensin II receptor type 1, underlining a potential role for angiotensin II receptor 1 antagonism in the treatment of lung fibrosis."
"Is ara h 8 , a Bet v 1-homologous allergen from peanut , a major allergen in patients with combined birch pollen and peanut allergy?",Peanut allergy might be mediated in a subgroup of our patients by means of cross-reaction of Bet v 1 with the homologous peanut allergen Ara h 8.
Do glucocorticoids upregulate FOXP3 expression and regulatory T cells in asthma?,These findings demonstrate that glucocorticoid treatment is not only immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory but also promotes or initiates differentiation toward T R 1 cells by a FOXP3-dependent mechanism. Strategies that convert transient glucocorticoid-induced T reg activity into a stable phenotype might improve allergy and asthma therapy.
Is meat consumption positively associated with psychomotor outcome in children up to 24 months of age?,"Meat intake, possibly via its effect on protein intake, is associated with increased weight gain in infants up to 12 months of age. Meat intake is also positively associated with psychomotor development at 22 months. These findings highlight the need for further investigation of the role of complementary foods in relation to health outcomes."
Is maternal recreational physical activity associated with plasma leptin concentrations in early pregnancy?,Our findings are consistent with other reports suggesting an independent inverse relationship between habitual physical activity and leptin concentrations. Our findings extend the literature to include pregnant women.
Does magnetic source imaging support clinical decision making in glioma patients?,Magnetic source imaging (MSI) proved to be a valuable help in the clinical decision making process of lesions adjacent to functional important brain areas. The relative high number of patients in whom MSI warns of the postoperative crippling sequelae may lead to a better selection of patients who benefit from resective surgery. This method may help to find the patients for whom conservative treatment seems to be more favourable concerning quality of life in the surviving time.
Do improvement of visual acuity in eyes with diabetic macular edema after treatment with pars plana vitrectomy?,"PPV almost always results in a reduction and often complete disappearance of DME as evidenced by ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein-angiography. Most importantly, central visual acuity often increases, sometimes to a very large extent with dramatic improvement in quality of life of the patients."
Is a distinct multicytokine profile associated with anti-cyclical citrullinated peptide antibodies in patients with early untreated inflammatory arthritis?,Early untreated inflammatory arthritis can be categorized into distinct subgroups based on cytokine profiles. These subgroups are associated with CCP and RF autoantibodies. Integration of cytokine profiles with autoantibody status may assist prognostication and treatment decisions in these patients.
Does increased noncanonical splicing of autoantigen transcripts provide the structural basis for expression of untolerized epitopes?,"These studies suggest that noncanonical alternative splicing may be an important mechanism for the generation of untolerized epitopes that may lead to autoimmunity. Furthermore, the product of a transcript that does not undergo alternative splicing is unlikely to be a target antigen in autoimmunity."
Are standard equations accurate in assessing resting energy expenditure in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?,"We found that standard equations used to calculate energy expenditure were not valid for patients with ALS. Moreover, the majority of our patients were either overfed or underfed. As underfeeding can cause diaphragm impairment, and overfeeding can increase ventilatory load, indirect calorimetry should be considered in ALS patients to determine optimal caloric requirement."
Does cellular HIV-1 DNA load predict HIV-RNA rebound and the outcome of highly active antiretroviral therapy?,Low cellular HIV-1 DNA load is a marker of sustained virological response in patients with initial VR and it can reliably predict the long-term success of HAART.
Do social-psychological correlates of peer victimization in children with endocrine disorders?,Recognition of the magnitude of the problem and means of evaluating for peer victimization is important for clinicians who see children with chronic diseases.
Do trait anger and the metabolic syndrome predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in healthy middle-aged women?,"Anger predicts progression of carotid atherosclerosis, and the metabolic syndrome may mediate this association. Women who experience angry feelings frequently may benefit from interventions aimed at reducing anger and reducing the metabolic syndrome components early in the natural history of atherosclerosis."
Does a novel mutation in the ELOVL4 gene cause autosomal dominant Stargardt-like macular dystrophy?,"In a European family with adSTGD-like MD, a novel ELOVL4 mutation was found to underlie the disorder. Transfection studies indicated that, unlike wild-type ELOVL4, the mutant protein does not localize to the ER but rather appears to be sequestered elsewhere in an aggregated pattern in the cytoplasm. Further analysis of the function of normal and mutant ELOVL4 will provide insight into the mechanism of macular degeneration."
Do cochlear implant surgery at 12 months of age or younger?,"In our experience, cochlear implant surgery is safe in children aged 7 to 12 months with appropriate anesthetic and postoperative support. The small incision technique is particularly suited to this age group. Ligature fixation of the device is considered advisable because of the increased risk of displacement from frequent falls when learning to walk."
Does a prospective cohort study to investigate risk factors for horse fall in UK hurdle and steeplechase racing?,Falls at fences are significant contributors to equine fatalities during NH racing. Potentially modifiable risk factors identified were the condition of track surfaces and journey time to the racecourse.
Are menisci efficiently transduced by recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors in vitro and in vivo?,The data suggest that recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors can directly and efficiently transfer and stably express foreign genes in isolated lapine and human meniscal cells in vitro and in lapine meniscal defects in vivo.
Is pre-transplant inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase activity associated with clinical outcome after renal transplantation?,Patients with low IMPDH activity experienced more complications of MMF therapy. High pre-transplant IMPDH activity and MMF dose reductions were associated with rejection. Determination of IMPDH activity prior to transplantation may help to improve MMF therapy after renal transplantation.
Does nutrition intervention improve outcomes in patients with cancer cachexia receiving chemotherapy -- a pilot study?,Nutrition intervention together with chemotherapy improved outcomes in patients with pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancer over 8 weeks. Supplement intake does not inhibit meal intake.
Are chromosomal abnormalities related to location and grade of osteoarthritis?,FISH analysis showed the presence of numerical chromosomal abnormalities in the articular cartilage of patients with OA.
"Does homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid , cobalamin , and pyridoxine reduce blood markers of inflammation , endothelial dysfunction , or hypercoagulability in patients with previous transient ischemic attack or stroke : a randomized substudy of the VITATOPS trial?","Lowering tHcy by 3.7 micromol/L with folic acid-based multivitamin therapy does not significantly reduce blood concentrations of the biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, or hypercoagulability measured in our study. The possible explanations for our findings are: (1) these biomarkers are not sensitive to the effects of lowering tHcy (eg, multiple risk factor interventions may be required); (2) elevated tHcy causes cardiovascular disease by mechanisms other than the biomarkers measured; or (3) elevated tHcy is a noncausal marker of increased vascular risk."
Do disability and service use among homeless people living with psychotic disorders?,"Despite high levels of contact with a well-organized, sectorized mental health service in an affluent country, this pocket of several hundred people had high levels of persisting disability and needs. The literature and local experience suggest that changing this situation is likely to require co-ordinated policy and practice between the health, welfare and housing sectors."
Does [ Electroretinogram `` b '' wave vary with the posology of the antimalarial treatment ]?,"This study has demonstrated the ERG ""b"" wave sensitivity due to the variation of HCQ consumption. The amplitude and the culmination time of the ERG ""b"" wave are important parameters to monitor during long term treatment with HCQ. A decrease of the ""b"" wave amplitude, coupled with an increase of its culmination time in a patient on long term HCQ treatment showing for the same daily dose, shall be a sign of alert, imposing the performance of additional visual functional tests and leading a decrease or a discontinuation of the treatment with HCQ. The ERG is an objective examination, which needs almost no participation from the patient. Its usefulness has been demonstrated, for the prevention of retinopathy due to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine intoxication in condition that successive ERGs of the same patient are precisely compared."
Are oncolytic herpes simplex virus mutants more efficacious than wild-type adenovirus Type 5 for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastomas in preclinical models?,Nb tumor models are resistant to adenovirus mediated oncolysis but highly sensitive to HSV mediated oncolysis. Further studies of HSV virotherapy as a novel treatment for Nb are warranted.
Do subcortical white matter metabolic changes remote from focal hemorrhagic lesions suggest diffuse injury after human traumatic brain injury?,"The extent and degree of subcortical WM metabolic abnormalities after moderate and severe TBI suggest that diffuse WM injury is a general phenomenon after such injuries. This pervasive finding may indicate that the concept of focal traumatic injury, although valid from a computed tomographic imaging standpoint, may be misleading when considering metabolic derangements associated with TBI."
Do changes in programming over time in postmeningitis cochlear implant users?,"Even with deafness accompanied by labyrinthine ossification attributed to meningitis, neural elements were present and could be stimulated. Because increasing levels of stimulation were required over time, postmeningitic children with CIs, and those with cochlear ossification in particular, may need frequent programming adjustments to maintain performance."
Is repeat FDG-PET after neoadjuvant therapy a predictor of pathologic response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer?,"The change in maxSUV on FDG-PET scan after neoadjuvant therapy holds a near linear relationship with pathologic response. It is a more accurate predictor than the change of size on CT scan. When the maxSUV decreases by 80% or more it is likely that the patient is a complete responder irrespective of cell type, neoadjuvant treatment, or the final absolute maxSUV. These findings may help guide treatment strategies."
Does adenosine triphosphate stress myocardial contrast echocardiography detect coronary artery stenosis with greater sensitivity than wall-motion abnormality measurements?,Real-time MCE has higher sensitivity in detecting coronary stenosis during adenosine triphosphate stress test when compared with wall-motion assessment.
Does docosahexaenoic acid complexed to albumin elicit high-grade ischemic neuroprotection?,The high-grade neuroprotection afforded by the DHA-albumin complex at relatively low albumin doses is clinically advantageous in that it might reduce the likelihood of acute intravascular volume overload and congestive heart failure sometimes induced when patients with compromised cardiovascular function are treated with high-dose albumin.
Does better knowledge improve adherence to lifestyle changes and medication in patients with coronary heart disease?,"Knowledge correlates to patient behaviour with respect to some risk factors, which should be recognised in preventive programs."
"Is the anti-fibrotic effect of pirfenidone in rat liver fibrosis mediated by downregulation of procollagen alpha1 ( I ) , TIMP-1 and MMP-2?","(1) Pirfenidone is effective also if administered after the induction of the hepatic damage; (2) the anti-fibrotic effect of pirfenidone is mainly due to the reduced expression of profibrogenic procollagen alpha1(I) and TIMP-1, most likely through the downregulation of transforming growth factorbeta1 mRNA, and of matrix metalloproteinase-2, which is mainly implicated in the degradation of the normal extracellular matrix."
Do ingestion of casein and whey proteins result in muscle anabolism after resistance exercise?,"Acute ingestion of both WH and CS after exercise resulted in similar increases in muscle protein net balance, resulting in net muscle protein synthesis despite different patterns of blood amino acid responses."
"Is the ventricular epicardial fat related to the myocardial mass in normal , ischemic and hypertrophic hearts?","A constant fat-muscle ratio exists in each ventricle, which is not influenced by ischemia or hypertrophy. Accordingly, during the hypertrophic process, the ventricular fat and the underlying myocardium show a parallel and correlated increase in their masses."
Does creatine supplementation decrease total plasma homocysteine in chronic hemodialysis patients?,"Creatine supplementation at a rate of 2 g/day does not further decrease tHcy concentrations in chronic dialysis patients already treated with high dose folic acid, vitamin B6, and B12 supplementation."
Is localized scleroderma an autoimmune disorder?,"Many previous studies conclude that localized scleroderma involves autoimmune abnormalities and is one of the organ-specific autoimmune disorders targeting mainly skin, although the types of autoimmune abnormality are different from systemic sclerosis."
Does [ The mutation V781I in SCN4A gene exist in Chinese patients with normokalemic periodic paralysis ]?,The mutation V781I exists in Chinese patients with normoKPP and may be responsible for normoKPP.
Is exclusion of HIV epitopes shared with human proteins prerequisite for designing safer AIDS vaccines?,The epitopes shared by HIV and its host are likely to be implicated in the immunopathogenesis of AIDS through induction of cross-reacting effectors of the immune system. The prospect that 'house-keeping' immune mechanism can be foiled by molecular mimicry of HIV with physiologically important human proteins should be taken into consideration in safer vaccine design.
Is staphylococcal enterotoxin A-induced hepatotoxicity predominantly mediated by Fas ligand ( CD95L )?,"These novel findings demonstrate that the mechanisms of hepatic injury in endotoxin-induced and superantigen-induced sepsis are principally different. On one hand, SEA-provoked hepatotoxicity is mediated by FasL and is not associated with leukocyte recruitment. On the other hand, liver damage provoked by LPS is mediated by TNF-alpha and characterized by prominent leukocyte responses. These data may facilitate development of more specific therapies against sepsis of different origins."
Does [ Gly374Arg mutation in Fgfr3 cause achondroplasia in mice ]?,The model of Fgfr3-Gly374Arg mutation causing achondroplasia in mice has been established successfully.
Is immunodominant PstS1 antigen of mycobacterium tuberculosis a potent biological response modifier for the treatment of bladder cancer?,"Our results demonstrate profound in vitro activation of human immune cells by recombinant PstS1. In addition, intravesical PstS1 immunotherapy induced strong local and systemic immune responses together with substantial anti-tumor activity in a preclinical mouse model. Thus, we have identified recombinant PstS1 antigen as a potent immunotherapeutic drug for cancer therapy."
Does detailed FISH analysis of day 5 human embryos reveal the mechanisms leading to mosaic aneuploidy?,"Post-zygotic chromosome loss was the most common mechanism leading to aneuploidy mosaicism for both groups, followed by chromosome gain, with fewer examples of mitotic non-disjunction."
Does growth hormone improve mobility and body composition in infants and toddlers with Prader-Willi syndrome?,GH treatment of infants and toddlers with PWS for 12 months significantly improves body composition and when begun before 18 months of age increases mobility skill acquisition. These results suggest that GH therapy instituted early in life may lessen deterioration of body composition in PWS while also accelerating motor development.
Are more favorable dietary patterns associated with lower glycemic load in older adults?,"Promoting appropriate portions of nutrient-dense carbohydrate foods, particularly whole grain, fruits, vegetables, and dairy foods, may offer reasonable guidance for lowering the glycemic load of the diet among older adults. A lower-glycemic-load diet may reduce the risk for obesity and many chronic diseases."
Does self-reported delay in seeking care have poor validity for predicting adverse outcomes?,The inability of self-reported delay to predict adverse outcomes in community-dwelling elderly suggests the need for better understanding and support of the care-seeking process and additional measures of timeliness of access.
Is laparoscopic gastric bypass superior to laparoscopic gastric banding for treatment of morbid obesity?,"Laparoscopic gastric banding and laparoscopic gastric bypass are feasible and safe. Pouch dilatations after gastric banding are responsible for more late complications compared with the gastric bypass. Laparoscopic gastric bypass offers a significant advantage regarding weight loss and reduction of comorbidities after surgery. Therefore, in our hands, laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass appears to be the therapy of choice."
Does methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genotype affect risk of relapse after hematopoietic cell transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia?,These findings suggest that individuals with the 677CC/1298AA genotype are at higher risk of relapse after hematopoietic cell transplantation and that the balance of intracellular folate metabolites available for nucleotide synthesis (regulated by the relative activity of the MTHFR enzyme) may affect the progression from bcr-abl positivity to clinical relapse.
Is maternal protein intake associated with infant blood pressure?,Variation in maternal total protein intake during pregnancy does not appear to program offspring blood pressure.
Do measures for preventing early postburn damage improve survival rate of burn patients?,Measures for preventing early postburn damage play an important role in improving the survival rate of burn patients.
Does [ Expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene in HCC depend on proliferating cell nuclear antigen and P53 ]?,The expression of hTERT gene may relate to the genesis and progression of HCC. There is no significant correlation between the expression of hTERT and PCNA and P53. The detection of hTERT gene expression may be regarded as a marker for recurrence of HCC.
Does centrophenoxine improve chronic cerebral ischemia induced cognitive deficit and neuronal degeneration in rats?,The abilities of CPH to attenuate memory deficits and neuronal damage after ischemia may be beneficial in cerebrovascular type dementia.
Do hippocampal volume in adult burn patients with and without posttraumatic stress disorder?,"PTSD is not a necessary condition for small hippocampal size in trauma-exposed individuals. Rather, the results provide evidence that smaller hippocampal size in trauma-exposed individuals is a result of traumatic stress. The posttraumatic application of NMDA antagonists may protect against hippocampal damage induced by traumatic stressors but increases the patient's risk of developing PTSD symptoms."
Does cCR1 blockade reduce interstitial inflammation and fibrosis in mice with glomerulosclerosis and nephrotic syndrome?,Blockade of CCR1 substantially reduced interstitial leukocyte accumulation and the subsequent renal fibrosis in a murine model of nephrotic syndrome and FSGS. These findings support a role for CCR1 in interstitial leukocyte recruitment and suggest that CCR1 blockade might be a new therapeutic strategy in progressive nephropathies such as FSGS.
Do proinflammatory parameters as CRP and IL-6 discriminate between post-PCI cardiac patients with and without exercise-induced ischemia as indicated by Tl-201 myocardial scintigraphy?,We conclude that measurement of these (inflammatory) parameters does not help to delineate post-PCI cardiac patients with and without exercise-induced ischemia.
Does foxo3a induce motoneuron death through the Fas pathway in cooperation with JNK?,"Therefore, in motoneurons as in other cell types, FOXO transcriptional regulators provide an important link between other signalling pathways and the cell death machinery."
Does epileptic activity influence the lateralization of mesiotemporal fMRI activity?,"The fMRI lateralization of mesiotemporal visuospatial memory functions in patients with mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is asymmetric: The larger activation usually appears contralateral to the side of the epileptogenic region. These findings occur more often in MTLE; in patients with extratemporal epilepsy, such type of asymmetry is not characteristic. In MTLE patients with bilateral independent epileptiform discharges, this type of asymmetry is also less frequent."
Does sociodemographic and symptom correlate of fatigue in an adolescent primary care sample?,"Abnormal fatigue is a disabling and prevalent condition in adolescents in primary care. It is associated with a number of additional symptoms, many of which may have viral origins."
Is chromoendoscopy using indigo carmine dye spraying with magnifying observation the most reliable method for differential diagnosis between non-neoplastic and neoplastic colorectal lesions : a prospective study?,Chromoendoscopy with magnification is the most reliable method for determining whether a colorectal lesion is non-neoplastic or neoplastic.
Does the advanced glycation end product pentosidine correlate to IL-6 and other relevant inflammatory markers in rheumatoid arthritis?,"The binding of AGE on cell receptors induces activation of nuclear factor kappa B, resulting in enhanced synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, AGE generation may also lead to the formation of new, immunologically relevant epitopes at synovial proteins. Both mechanisms could contribute to initiation and perpetuation of the inflammatory and destructive processes in RA."
Does sleep deprivation affect thermal pain thresholds but not somatosensory thresholds in healthy volunteers?,The present findings suggest that sleep deprivation produces hyperalgesic changes that cannot be explained by nonspecific alterations in somatosensory functions.
Does disc inflammation potentially promote axonal regeneration of dorsal root ganglion neurons innervating lumbar intervertebral disc in rats?,"The present results suggest that disc inflammation potentially promotes axonal growth of DRG neurons innervating the disc. In light of the strong correlation between the expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide and nerve growth factor receptor, it is most likely that nerve growth factor-sensitive DRG neurons extend their axons following disc inflammation."
Does histidine supplementation suppress food intake and fat accumulation in rats?,Our results indicate that dietary histidine suppresses food intake and fat accumulation in rats.
Does methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism determine the plasma homocysteine-lowering effect of large-dose folic acid supplementation in patients with cardiovascular disease?,The MTHFR polymorphism may be involved in the total homocysteine-lowering effect of folic acid in patients who have cardiovascular disease.
Do breast-fed infants have higher leptin values than formula-fed infants in the first four months of life?,The kind of feeding might be a factor affecting serum leptin concentration in term infants.

Is the PlA1/A2 polymorphism of platelet glycoprotein IIIa associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes . The Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health study?,"The GPIIIa PlA1/A2 polymorphism is not associated with type 2 diabetes, glucose metabolism, angiographic CHD or myocardial infarction."
"Does nimesulide , a COX-2 inhibitor , reduce lesion size or number in a nude mouse model of endometriosis?",The hypothesized biological properties of COX-2 inhibition did not influence lesion number or size in the nude mouse model of endometriosis.
Does meta-analysis show schizophrenia is not associated with the 40-base-pair repeat polymorphism of the dopamine transporter gene?,"Despite over 90% power to detect a significant odds ratio as small as 1.3, no association was observed. Considering the cumulative evidence from six case-control studies and results from additional family-based studies, it seems unlikely that the 40-base-pair VTNR polymorphism of the SLC6A3 gene influences risk for schizophrenia."
Do vision impairment and combined vision and hearing impairment predict cognitive and functional decline in older women?,Sensory impairment is associated with cognitive and functional decline in older women. Studies are needed to determine whether treatment of vision and hearing impairment can decrease the risk for cognitive and functional decline.
Do cochlear implant fixation using polypropylene mesh and titanium screws?,"We conclude that this technique is widely applicable, technically superior, and not associated with increased complications."
Does lead exposure raise superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells?,"Lead exposure promotes generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in human EC and VSMC. This phenomenon can potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of the lead-associated hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and points to the potential benefit of lowering lead burden in the exposed populations."
Does menstrual cycle influence on pain and emotion in women with fibromyalgia?,"Although FM pain did not vary across the menstrual cycle, these results point to the importance of considering the lower level and cyclical nature of positive affect when studying women with chronic pain."
Is preoperative cerebral blood flow diminished in neonates with severe congenital heart defects?,Structural brain abnormalities are common in these neonates before surgical intervention. Preoperative cerebral blood flow for this cohort was low and drastically reduced in some patients. Low cerebral blood flow values were associated with periventricular leukomalacia. Carbon dioxide reactivity was preserved but might be compromised by some aspects of the cardiac anatomy. The full spectrum of cerebral blood flow measurements with this technique in congenital heart defects and their long-term significance require continued investigation.
Do white matter changes in healthy elderly persons correlate with attention and speed of mental processing?,"Leukoaraiosis could explain some of the intellectual impairment in the elderly, especially that of slowing of distinct motor and attentional functions, as well as slowing of mental processing. Mild LA in normal aged subjects could also signal brain at risk for further cognitive impairment."
Do soluble factors modulate changes in collagen gene expression in abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"There is no increase in tissue AOD procollagen gene expression. The ability to transfer the same relative patterns of gene expression from tissue to target SMC with conditioned media suggests that paracrine, rather than autocrine, factors modulate procollagen expression in AAA tissues."
Do interindividual differences in the pituitary-thyroid axis influence the interpretation of thyroid function tests?,"The presence of significant age and gender-independent interindividual variations in the setpoint of the pituitary-thyroid axis raises conceptual problems with the current approach for interpreting thyroid function tests. An easy to use graphical bivariate representation of the normal ranges for thyroid function tests is presented and exemplified by the thyroid hormone and TSH measurements in a large reference population. This concept should improve the diagnostic accuracy in the borderline-normal, and particularly subclinical hypothyroid region of these hormone measurements."
Do temporal lobe regions on magnetic resonance imaging identify patients with early Alzheimer 's disease?,The results suggest that the hippocampus and the temporal horn of the lateral ventricles may be useful as antemortem markers of AD in mildly impaired patients.
Is hyperglycemia in the acute phase of stroke caused by stress?,We conclude that hyperglycemia in the acute phase of stroke cannot be explained by increased stress.
Is abdominal obesity associated with insulin resistance?,The high-WHR group (abdominal obesity) was more resistant to the action of insulin. These results suggest that measurement of the WHR could help define the degree of medical risk for a given obese patient seeking treatment.
Do subanesthetic concentrations of isoflurane suppress learning as defined by the category-example task?,"The ED50 that suppressed explicit learning in our volunteers equaled that previously reported (0.2 MAC) for implicit learning in volunteers measured using a different task. Combined, these results suggest that less than 0.45 MAC isoflurane suppresses learning in volunteers."
Do serum erythropoietin level and marrow erythroid infiltration predict response to recombinant human erythropoietin in myelodysplastic syndromes?,"Under recombinant human erythropoietin, three patients became transfusion-independent and 5 had a transient decrease of their transfusion requirement. Two patients under prolonged treatment at the same dose of erythropoietin remain in complete remission after 12 and 15 months respectively. A direct relationship between response to erythropoietin treatment and degree of bone marrow erythroid hyperplasia, coupled to an inverse correlation between response to erythropoietin and baseline serum erythropoietin levels were noted. Based on these findings, recombinant human erythropoietin may represent an effective treatment modality for selected patients with MDS."
Is expression of p53 protein an early event in ultraviolet light-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinogenesis?,"These results indicate that UV acts as a mutagen for the p53 gene, and this event may occur at a relatively early stage of multistep UV carcinogenesis."
Does the value of early treatment of deer tick bite for the prevention of Lyme disease?,"Based on the low frequency of illness, the absence of stage II disease, and the inability to establish the efficacy of early antibiotic treatment, we suggest that physicians not routinely use prophylactic antibiotics for deer tick bites."
Does protection of monkeys by a split vaccine against SIVmac depend upon biological properties of the challenge virus?,"Neither the antibody nor the proliferative T-cell response to SIVmac correlates with protection from virus challenge. In contrast to SIVmac251/32H grown on C8166 cells, the MPBMC-grown challenge virus SIVmac251 appears to belong to the 'rapid-high' phenotype, possibly explaining the lack of protection against this SIV."
Does initial motor impairment influence activation pattern of motor recovery?,"Our study demonstrates that the fMRI pattern varies according to functional recovery, suggesting the importance of the ipsilateral premotor area and postcentral gyrus especially for those patients with severe motor impairment initially."
Is prostate volume strongest predictor of cancer diagnosis at transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy with prostate-specific antigen values between 2.0 and 9.0 ng/mL?,"When the PSA level is in the 2.0 to 9.0 ng/mL range, a smaller prostate volume is the strongest predictor of cancer detection. These data support previous studies suggesting the amount of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and not cancer, as the major factor responsible for elevated PSA."
"Are resistin polymorphisms associated with muscle , bone , and fat phenotypes in white men and women?",These data support previous identified associations of RST with adipose tissue and demonstrate additional associations with bone and skeletal muscle that warrant further investigation.
Is total thyroidectomy the preferred treatment for patients with Graves ' disease and a thyroid nodule?,Total thyroidectomy for Graves' has minimal morbidity. Patients with Graves' and a thyroid nodule are at an increased risk for malignancy and should be treated with a total thyroidectomy.
Is eyelid myoclonia with absences : routine EEG sufficient to make a diagnosis?,"EMA is not uncommon; diagnosis can be made with good clinical history and routine EEG. As developmental delay is a common association with EMA in this study, early identification and treatment are important."
Does comparative analysis of genome tiling array data reveal many novel primate-specific functional RNAs in human?,"The existence of potential primate-specific functional transcripts has demonstrated the limitation of previous genome comparison studies, which put too much emphasis on conservation between human and rodents. It also argues for the necessity of sequencing additional primate species to gain a better and more comprehensive understanding of the human genome."
Do metabolite findings in tumefactive demyelinating lesions utilizing short echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy?,"MR spectroscopic metabolite information may be useful in the diagnosis of demyelinating disease by demonstrating elevation of the glutamate/glutamine peaks because elevation of these peaks is typically not seen in aggressive intra-axial neoplastic processes. This is particularly beneficial in the rarer cases of tumefactive demyelinating lesions, which are very difficult to differentiate from neoplasms by imaging findings alone."
Does attentional re-training decrease attentional bias in heavy drinkers without generalization?,"Although heavy drinkers can learn to attend selectively to an alternative category for alcohol, a single AR is not sufficient to decrease symptoms of problem drinking."
Are the in vivo antitumoral effects of lipopolysaccharide against glioblastoma multiforme mediated in part by Toll-like receptor 4?,"LPS-induced antitumoral effects on glioblastoma multiforme are mediated, in part, by the Tlr-4 receptor. Further understanding of this process may lead to novel treatment strategies for this uniformly fatal disease."
Is a history of aggression a risk factor for postoperative confusion in elderly male drinkers?,A history of aggression in elderly male drinkers is associated with postoperative confusion.
Does rectal acetaminophen reduce morphine consumption after major surgery in young infants?,"Acetaminophen, as an adjuvant to continuous morphine infusion, does not have an additional analgesic effect and should not be considered as standard of care in young infants, 0-2 months of age, after major thoracic (non-cardiac) or abdominal surgery."
Does american Joint Committee on Cancer staging system accurately predict survival in patients receiving multimodality therapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma?,"The current AJCC staging system is not a good predictor of survival after CRT. Although patients with a pCR do have improved long-term survival relative to patients with residual disease, this method places too much emphasis on residual depth of invasion and fails to identify patients with residual disease who have good long-term survival. Recursive partitioning analysis more accurately identifies nodal disease and metastatic disease as the most important prognostic variables. Degree of treatment response is less prognostic than nodal involvement."
Is small artery elasticity assessed by pulse wave analysis no measure of endothelial dysfunction?,Our findings show that static measurement of vascular parameters by an automated pulse-wave analysis procedure cannot be used to assess endothelial function. Further studies are needed to examine whether a dynamic measurement of arterial compliance before and after stimulation of the endothelium (e.g. by ischemia) might quantify endothelial dilatory capacity in a better way.
Does identification and correlate of weight loss in adolescents in a national sample?,This study provides a method to determine successful adolescent weight loss for researchers and provides useful concrete information about successful weight loss for clinicians and others who work with adolescents.
Are high visceral fat mass and high liver fat associated with resistance to lifestyle intervention?,"Baseline values and changes in BMI, VAT, and LF are related to changes in insulin sensitivity during lifestyle intervention. Subjects with high VAT and LF have a lower chance of profiting from lifestyle intervention and may require intensified lifestyle prevention strategies or even pharmacological approaches to improve insulin sensitivity."
Is human papillomavirus subtype 16 common in Pakistani women with cervical carcinoma?,Our results show a strong relationship between HPV infection and cervical cancer among Pakistani women. These results underscore the need to implement regular HPV screening for Pakistani women. An early diagnosis of HPV infection will allow better health management to reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer.
Does strain rate imaging differentiate hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy from physiologic cardiac hypertrophy ( athlete 's heart )?,"Hypertensive LVH has significant longitudinal strain, SR(S), and SR(E) reductions versus control. The lack of these reductions in athletes suggests that strain rate imaging may have clinical use in discerning the physiologic LVH state."
Does oxygen treatment restore energy status following experimental neonatal hypoxia-ischemia?,"These results suggest that oxygen treatment during the initial period of recovery from a hypoxia-ischemic insult is able to attenuate energy deficits in the brain, which ultimately leads to a reduction in brain injury."
Does loss of claudin-1 expression correlate with malignancy of hepatocellular carcinoma?,Attenuated expression of CL-1 closely correlates with the dedifferentiation and portal invasion of HCC. Down-regulated CL-1 expression may serve as a potential marker for a poor prognosis in HCC.
Is hormonal therapy associated with a lower prevalence of breast arterial calcification on mammography?,"Well-established cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, stroke, and age) appear to be associated with a significantly higher incidence of BAC, while HT during the menopausal years appears to be associated with a significantly lower prevalence of BAC."
Does systolic blood pressure in childhood predict hypertension and metabolic syndrome later in life?,Children with systolic blood pressures above the criterion values established in this longitudinal study are at increased risk of hypertension and the metabolic syndrome later in life.
Does speed of tPA-induced clot lysis predict DWI lesion evolution in acute stroke?,"The speed of tPA-induced clot lysis predicts DWI lesion evolution and clinical outcome. Unlike sudden and stepwise patterns, slow recanalization is associated with greater DWI lesion growth and poorer short- and long-term outcomes."
"Is endogenous estrogen associated with cognitive performance before , during , or after menopause?",These results do not support the hypothesis that estrogen or menopausal status affects cognitive performance in middle-aged women.
Does weight of decision-making impair clinical assessment of melanocytic lesions?,"The accuracy of clinical assessment of melanocytic lesions is high for benign nevi, with dermatologists outperforming nondermatologists. Clinicians overestimated malignant potential. Complete removal was more frequent in suspicious lesions. Clinical decision-making impaired assessment by 5 to 9%."
Is interleukin 6 associated with cachexia in patients with prostate cancer?,These findings suggest that IL-6 may be one of the factors contributing to the complex syndrome of cachexia in patients with prostate cancer (all P <0.05).
Does intraoperative neurological changes in 1665 regional anaesthetic carotid endarterectomies predict postoperative stroke?,Regional anaesthetic CEA is a safe and effective technique with excellent morbidity and mortality rates. The technique can be undertaken safely regardless of the indication for endarterectomy or the status of the contralateral carotid artery. Patients who developed intraoperative neurological changes requiring shunting are identified as high risk for perioperative stroke or mortality and should therefore be carefully monitored postoperatively.
Does a screen for nuclear transcripts identify two linked noncoding RNAs associated with SC35 splicing domains?,Our genome-wide screens in two mammalian species reveal no more than three abundant large non-coding polyadenylated RNAs in the nucleus; the canonical large noncoding RNA XIST and NEAT1 and NEAT2. The function of these noncoding RNAs in mRNA metabolism is suggested by their high levels of conservation and their intimate association with SC35 splicing domains in multiple mammalian species.
Does the parathyroid/pituitary variant of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 usually have causes other than p27Kip1 mutations?,"The MEN1 variant with sporadic parathyroid tumors, sporadic pituitary tumor, and no identified MEN1 mutation is usually not caused by p27 germline mutations. It is usually caused by as yet unknown process(es)."
Are reduced time in bed and obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children associated with cognitive impairment?,Short or variable time in bed and nightly snoring or higher apnea hypopnea index predicted impaired vocabulary and similarities scores in children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy suspected of having obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. The degree of cognitive impairment attributable to short time in bed and obstructive sleep-disordered breathing is clinically very significant.
Do internal medicine residents accurately assess their medical knowledge?,IM residents did not accurately predict their own level of medical knowledge. Taking the examination and experience with previous exams does not appear to improve the ability of these IM residents to predict their performance. Residents need to be taught to rely on the results of standardized examinations such as the ITE to best assess their overall medical knowledge. The factors important for accurate self-assessment of medical knowledge in individual clinical situations remain unexplored.
Does combined type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor and NOD2/CARD15 genotyping predict complicated Crohn 's disease behaviour?,Combined PAI-1 and NOD2/CARD15 genotyping predict complicated Crohn's disease. Patients with these variants could benefit from early interventions.
"Is allergenicity and antigenicity of wild-type and mutant , monomeric , and dimeric carrot major allergen Dau c 1 : destruction of conformation , not oligomerization , the roadmap to save allergen vaccines?",Destruction of native conformation rather than oligomerization is the appropriate strategy to reduce the allergenicity of Bet v 1-homologous food allergens.
Is prefrontal cortex activity reduced in gambling and nongambling substance users during decision-making?,"Our results support a hypothesis that defects in ventral medial frontal processing lead to impaired decisions that involve risk. Reductions in right prefrontal activity during decision-making appear to be modulated by the presence of gambling problems and may reflect impaired working memory, stimulus reward valuation, or cue reactivity in substance-dependent individuals."
Is improved posttreatment functional outcome associated with better survival in patients irradiated for metastatic spinal cord compression?,"The response to RT and the post-RT ambulatory status are important predictors for survival in MSCC patients. This finding can be used by physicians to stratify future studies, plan further therapy, and improve follow-up strategy in these patients."
Does quantified corticospinal tract diffusion restriction predict neonatal stroke outcome?,"Descending corticospinal tracts diffusion-weighted MRI signal is predictive of motor outcome from neonatal arterial ischemic stroke. This accurate, reliable, and simple tool will impact decision making in acute neonatal stroke."
"Is low-grade inflammation a risk factor for clinical stroke events in addition to silent cerebral infarcts in Japanese older hypertensives : the Jichi Medical School ABPM Study , wave 1?","High-sensitivity C-reactive protein is a risk factor for clinical stroke events in addition to silent cerebral infarcts in Japanese older hypertensives, indicating that the risk for clinical stroke events increases with preexisting hypertensive target organ damage in the brain and additionally with ongoing low-grade inflammation."
Is recombinant bovine growth hormone-induced reduction of atrial natriuretic peptide associated with improved left ventricular contractility and reverse remodeling in cardiomyopathic UM-X7.1 hamsters with congestive heart failure?,The data show that a short-term administration of GH in the terminal phase of the disease confers cardioprotection by attenuating systolic dysfunction and by inducing beneficial reverse remodeling.
Do adrenal gland volume and dexamethasone-suppressed cortisol correlate with total daily salivary cortisol in African-American women?,A dexamethasone suppression test or adrenal gland volume may be alternative measures for characterizing subtle subclinical hypercortisolism in healthy adults.
Do acute ischemic lesions of varying ages predict risk of ischemic events in stroke/TIA patients?,The presence of multiple diffusion-weighted imaging lesions of varying ages suggests very active early recurrence over time and portends a higher early risk of future ischemic events.
Are food spending behaviors and perceptions associated with fruit and vegetable intake among parents and their preadolescent children?,Public health efforts to raise awareness of the relatively low cost of fruits and vegetables should be continued. These efforts may be complemented with policy strategies that make fruits and vegetables more viable options for low-income households.
Does cement augmentation of vertebral screws enhance the interface strength between interbody device and vertebral body?,Cage-vertebra interface properties were improved when cement was used to augment vertebral and pedicle screws. Cement augmentation of pedicle or anterior screws may reduce interbody device subsidence.
Are somatoform dissociation and somatosensory amplification differentially associated with attention to the tactile modality following exposure to body-related stimuli?,"Individuals with a tendency to experience somatoform symptoms focus more on stimuli in the tactile modality immediately following exposure to threatening body-relevant information. In contrast, self-reported somatosensory amplification appears to be associated with attention away from the tactile modality rather than with increased tactile focus."
Do relationship between diabetes and mortality among persons with co-occurring psychotic and substance use disorders?,"Interventions targeted for diabetes prevention and diabetes management are critical for persons with serious mental illness, particularly among those who also abuse substances."
Are lacunar infarcts the main correlate with cognitive dysfunction in CADASIL?,Lacunar infarct lesion load is the most important MRI parameter associated with cognitive dysfunction in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
Does dietary sialic acid supplementation improve learning and memory in piglets?,Feeding a protein-bound source of sialic acid during early development enhanced learning and increased expression of 2 genes associated with learning in developing piglets. Sialic acid in mammalian milks could play a role in cognitive development.
Do chronic celecoxib users more often show regression of gastric intestinal metaplasia after Helicobacter pylori eradication?,"With H. pylori infection, chronic celecoxib users still showed limited effects to decrease intestinal metaplasia. Nevertheless, celecoxib should be promising to assist H. pylori eradication for the control of gastric intestinal metaplasia and cancer risk."
Do specific secondary genetic alterations in mantle cell lymphoma provide prognostic information independent of the gene expression-based proliferation signature?,"Cyclin D1-positive and -negative MCLs share the same secondary genetic aberrations, supporting the concept that they correspond to the same genetic entity. The integration of genetic information on chromosome 3q and 9q alterations into a proliferation signature-based model may improve the ability to predict survival in patients with MCL."
Does adrenocortical suppression increase the risk of relapse in nephrotic syndrome?,Children with NS receiving long-term alternate day prednisolone therapy are at risk of developing HPA suppression and should be evaluated using the modified synacthen test. Children with evidence of HPA suppression are at a greater risk of relapse.
Does refill non-adherence to repeat prescriptions lead to treatment gaps or to high extra costs?,"Both undersupply and oversupply of prescribed medicines are common in Sweden. Patients with a refill adherence below 80% seem to have less than half of the prescribed treatment available. Oversupply or drug stockpiling occurs more frequently among exempt than among non-exempt patients, and this oversupply leads to high unnecessary costs."
Are food insecurity and gender risk factors for obesity?,Obesity prevention programs and policies need to address food insecurity and gender as key risk factors.
Does body mass index predict prostate-specific antigen or percent free prostate-specific antigen in men undergoing prostate cancer screening?,"Body mass index does not affect PSA or %fPSA in men without known prostate cancer, who undergo prostate cancer screening. Therefore, PSA or %fPSA-based screening or early detection efforts do not require an adjustment for BMI."
Are surgeons failing to recognize children with HIV infection?,"It is likely that the incidence of HIV/AIDS infection is higher than the 4% identified in our study group. The surgical manifestations in these HIV-positive children are dominated by sepsis, often severe in nature and with opportunistic pathogens. Despite increased knowledge about the disease and widening therapeutic opportunities, our results suggest that many children with HIV infection are not being recognized, despite entry into the healthcare system. Prompt recognition and surgical management of the complications of pediatric HIV infection can sometimes result in a good outcome. Further studies are therefore required to define the true incidence of HIV/AIDS infection in children presenting as a surgical emergency case. These patients may benefit from early antiretroviral therapy. Surgeons are well placed to identify children who are HIV positive and should do more to ensure HIV testing and enrollment into antiretroviral treatment programs."
Does school-based physical activity compromise children 's academic performance?,The AS! BC model is an attractive and feasible intervention to increase physical activity for students while maintaining levels of academic performance.
Do effects of direct-to-consumer advertising of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase inhibitors on attainment of LDL-C goals?,"The results of this study suggest that higher levels of DTC television advertising of statin treatment were significantly associated with improvements in the likelihood of attaining cholesterol-management goals for at least some patients. While this paper does not address the impact of DTC advertising on the costs of care or on unnecessary switching between statin treatments, the results do suggest that DTC advertising can have beneficial effects, which should be a factor when additional restrictions on DTC advertising are considered. This result-that DTC ad vertising might have beneficial effects-should be weighed against existing studies that have found that patients' suggestions (conceptually which could be induced by DTC advertising) may be associated with overprescribing (eg, in the case of the use of antidepressants for adjustment disorder)."
Is hippocampal activation in patients with mild cognitive impairment necessary for successful memory encoding?,"These results suggest that in patients with MCI, an increase in MTL activation is necessary for successful memory encoding. Hippocampal activation may help to link newly learned information to items already stored in memory. Increased activation in MTL regions in MCI may reflect a compensatory response to the beginning of AD pathology."
Does fish oil supplementation alter energy efficiency in healthy males?,FO supplementation did not significantly alter energy metabolism and energy efficiency during exercise in healthy humans.
Is cardiovascular fitness negatively associated with homocysteine levels in female adolescents?,The results suggest that cardiovascular fitness is negatively associated with homocysteine levels in female adolescents after controlling for potential cofounders including MTHFR 677C>T genotype.
Does combined quantitative supine-prone myocardial perfusion SPECT improve detection of coronary artery disease and normalcy rates in women?,Combined supine-prone quantitative MPS in women yields significantly increased specificity and normalcy rates without compromising sensitivity for the detection of CAD compared with standard analysis.
Are genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 related to drug-induced idiosyncratic liver injury ( DILI )?,We find no evidence to support CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms as predictable potential risk factors for DILI.
Does intraoperative cholangiography facilitate simple transcystic clearance of ductal stones in units without expertise for laparoscopic bile duct surgery?,"In this series, 10% of the abnormal cholangiograms occurred in patients without preoperative risk factors for bile duct stones. Altogether, 88 IOCs (31%) were cleared after either simple flushing or trawling with a Dormia basket. Formal LBDE was not required for 40% of abnormal cholangiograms. Simple transcystic manipulations to clear the bile ducts justify the use of routine IOC in units without laparoscopic biliary expertise."
Does hypernatremia predict adverse cardiovascular and neurological outcomes after SAH?,"In the acute period after SAH, hypernatremia is associated with adverse cardiac outcomes and death. SAH patients with hypernatremia should be monitored for evidence of cardiac dysfunction."
Do higher concentrations of alanine aminotransferase within the reference interval predict nonalcoholic fatty liver disease?,"In apparently healthy, nondiabetic Korean men, increased ALT concentration, even within the reference interval, was an independent predictor of incident NAFLD."
Do chronic rhinosinusitis patients with polyps or polypoid mucosa have a greater burden of illness?,"Compared with CRSsNP, patients with CRScNP have a greater burden of symptoms, more prior surgery, higher CT scan scores, and greater use of medications."
Is use of modern contraception by the poor falling behind?,"The secular trend of increasing rates of modern contraceptive use has not resulted in a decrease of the gap in use for those living in absolute poverty. Countries with large economic inequalities also exhibit large inequalities in modern contraceptive use. In addition to macro level factors that influence contraceptive use, such as economic development and provision of reproductive health services, there are strong regional variations, with sub-Saharan Africa exhibiting the lowest national rates of use, South and Southeast Asia the highest use among the poor, and Latin America the largest inequalities in use."
Does best lead in the standard electrocardiogram for the emergency detection of acute coronary syndrome?,"Our results indicate that leads III, aVL, and V2 are sufficient for computerized prediction of ACS. The present results are likely important in situations where the 12-lead ECG is impractical and for the creation of clinical decision support systems for ECG prediction of ACS."
Is sinonasal epithelial cell expression of toll-like receptor 9 decreased in chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps?,"Functional TLR9 protein is expressed by normal and diseased sinonasal epithelial cells. The level of TLR9 expression is decreased in CRSwNP patients, consistent with the previous finding of decreased TLR9 mRNA in whole sinonasal tissue. These findings suggest that impaired innate immune responses to pathogens via TLR9 on sinonasal epithelial cells may represent a critical mechanism in chronic inflammatory sinus disease."
Does prevalence and correlate of binge eating disorder in a community sample?,"PHQ-BED criteria are associated with substantial impairment, psychiatric comorbidity, and obesity and effectively discriminate obese individuals with psychological problems from obese subjects without similar problems. BED may be considerably more prevalent than other eating disorders and equally prevalent among men and women."
Are proinflammatory macrophage migratory inhibition factor and interleukin-6 concentrated in pleural effusion of human fetuses with prenatal chylothorax?,"Our study demonstrated that the levels of pro-inflammatory proteins (MIF and IL-6) that we tested were higher in the fetal pleural effusion than in the fetal circulation, a phenomenon not observed in the levels of proangiogenic proteins (HGF, SDF-1, VEGF, IL-8). This result implies that inflammation-related proteins may be more relevant than the angiogenesis-related proteins in the local environment of accumulating pleural effusion, a prominent feature of prenatal chylothorax."
Does evaluation of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging contrast in MRI-negative refractory focal epilepsy?,"Quantitative analysis of MRI contrasts had a low yield of identifying focal abnormalities concordant with putative epileptic foci in patients with unremarkable conventional MRI. Specificity was low for FFT2 and DIR. With the low specificity, data must be interpreted with caution, but in some patients may assist in creating a hypothesis for testing with intracranial electrodes."
Are ovarian dysgerminomas characterised by frequent KIT mutations and abundant expression of pluripotency markers?,"This study provides new data supporting two distinct but overlapping pathways in OGCT development; one involving spontaneous KIT mutation(s) leading to increased survival and proliferation of undifferentiated oogonia, the other related to presence of Y chromosome material and ensuing gonadal dysgenesis in phenotypic females."
Does multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification detect DCX gene deletions in band heterotopia?,MLPA uncovers large genomic deletions of the DCX gene in a subset of patients with SBH in whom no mutations are found after gene sequencing. Deletions of DCX are an underascertained cause of SBH.
Do interleukin 18 gene polymorphisms predict risk and outcome of Alzheimer 's disease?,"As IL-18 cytokine promoter gene polymorphisms have been previously described to have functional consequences on IL-18 expression, it is possible that individuals with a prevalent IL-18 gene variant have a dysregulated immune response, suggesting that IL-18 mediated immune mechanisms may play a crucial role in AD."
Does cholinesterase inhibitor use significantly influence the ability of 123I-FP-CIT imaging to distinguish Alzheimer 's disease from dementia with Lewy bodies?,Use of ChEi does not significantly influence the ability of 123I-FP-CIT imaging to distinguish AD from DLB.
Does intermittent hypoxia cause insulin resistance in lean mice independent of autonomic activity?,"We conclude that IH can cause acute insulin resistance in otherwise lean, healthy animals, and that the response is associated with decreased glucose utilization of oxidative muscle fibers, but that it occurs independently of activation of the ANS."
Do remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness but not cellular inflammation persist after allergen challenge in asthma?,"In dual responders with asthma, the 24-hour increase in airway wall cellular inflammation after allergen challenge resolves by 7 days, whereas the increases in AHR and markers of remodeling persist."
Is calcification of human articular knee cartilage primarily an effect of aging rather than osteoarthritis?,These observations indicate that age rather than OA is the predominant factor driving progressive pathologic calcification in articular cartilage.
Do single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) distinguish Indian-origin and Chinese-origin rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta )?,"This study demonstrates that the 3' end of genes is rich in sequence polymorphisms and is suitable for the efficient discovery of gene-linked SNPs. In addition, the results show that the genomic sequences of Indian and Chinese rhesus macaque are remarkably divergent, and include numerous population-specific SNPs. These ancestral SNPs could be used for the rapid scanning of rhesus macaques, both to establish animal ancestry and to identify gene alleles that may contribute to the phenotypic differences observed in these populations."
Do alcohol cues increase cognitive impulsivity in individuals with alcoholism?,"These results demonstrate that alcoholics exhibit a basic prepotent response inhibition deficit, which is enhanced when the response to be suppressed is related to alcohol. We discuss clinical and theoretical implications of these findings."
Is gABRA6 genetic polymorphism associated with the risk of functional heartburn in Chinese?,"Chinese patients with certain psychiatric characteristics and GABRA6 heterozygosity are probably predisposed to functional heartburn, providing insight into this condition's psychopathology and genetics."
Do trajectories of adolescent alcohol and cannabis use into young adulthood?,"Heavier teenage cannabis users tend to continue selectively with cannabis use. Considering their poor young adult outcomes, regular adolescent cannabis users appear to be on a problematic trajectory."
Is in-room display of day and time patient anticipated to leave hospital : a `` discharge appointment ''?,"With a program for in-room display of a DA in various hospital units, more than half the patients had a DA set, and most of the DA patients departed on time. Further investigation is needed to determine the effect of DAs on patient and provider satisfaction."
"Are serum adiponectin levels , insulin resistance , and lipid profile in children born small for gestational age affected by the severity of growth retardation at birth?","SGA children, although more insulin resistant, had similar or higher adiponectin levels than matched AGA children in pre-puberty. The severity of IUGR appears to affect their metabolic profile during childhood."
Are two-dimensional tracking and TDI consistent methods for evaluating myocardial longitudinal peak strain in left and right ventricle basal segments in athletes?,"Provided that echographic imaging is good, strain can be computed in athletes by both Doppler-derived and tracking methods. It is technically feasible to use both -interchangeably, at least in basal segments."
Is apoE-epsilon4 associated with reduced memory in long-standing intractable temporal lobe epilepsy?,"The ApoE-epsilon4 allele interacts with longstanding seizures to affect memory performance, both verbal and nonverbal, in patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy."
Does statin pre-treatment protect brain against focal cerebral ischemia in diabetic mice?,These data suggest that diabetes aggravates the ischemic damage after focal cerebral ischemia and statin pre-treatment protects the brain in diabetic as well as healthy animals.

Do prescription dose and fractionation predict improved survival after stereotactic radiotherapy for brainstem metastases?,"SRT/SRS for brainstem metastases is safe and achieves a high rate of local control. We found higher GPA as well as greater number of treatment fractions and higher prescription dose to be correlated with improved overall survival. Despite this approach, prognosis remains poor and distant intracranial control remains an issue, even in patients previously treated with WBRT."
Do [ Positron emission tomography plus VEEG in the localization of epileptic foci in negative-MRI interact epilepsy ]?,"PET imaging is both sensitive and effective in the detection and localization of epileptogenic foci. Especially for MRI-negative cases, it is an indispensable tool of localizing epileptogenic foci."
Do specialized ambulatory anesthesia teams contribute to decreased ambulatory surgery recovery room length of stay?,The decreased PACU LOS for the study group's patients occurred despite the increased incidence of PONV. Ambulatory anesthesiologists contributed to decreased PACU LOS while practicing evidence-based anesthesia with regard to PONV and pain control. Ambulatory subspecialization may benefit institutions as a way to increase perioperative efficiency and improve surgeon and patient satisfaction.
Does monitoring breathing rate at home allow early identification of COPD exacerbations?,"Respiratory frequency can be monitored daily at home in patients with COPD receiving domiciliary oxygen therapy. In these patients, breathing rate increases significantly days before they require hospitalization because of ECOPD. This may offer a window of opportunity for early intervention."
Do wedge volume and osteotomy surface depend on surgical technique for distal femoral osteotomy?,"Bone geometry following DFO suggests that the medial biplanar closed-wedge technique simultaneously creates smaller wedge volume and larger bone surface areas compared to the lateral biplanar open-wedge and the uniplanar DFO techniques. The horizontal cuts of the biplane DFO techniques are positioned behind the trochlear area in better healing metaphysial bone, which further enhances bone healing potential. Although this idealized geometric view on bony geometry excludes all biological factors that influence bone healing, the current data confirm the general rule for osteotomy techniques: reducing the amount of slow gap healing and wedge volumes and simultaneously increasing the area of faster contact healing by larger bone surface areas may be beneficial for osteotomy healing."
Is age-related cataract associated with type 2 diabetes and statin use?,"In this population, statin use was substantially higher in patients with type 2 diabetes and was associated with AR cataracts. Further long-term study is warranted to recommend monitoring of crystalline lenses in patients with type 2 diabetes benefiting from statins."
Is myopia progression in Chinese children slower in summer than in winter?,"Myopia progression in summer months was approximately 60% of that seen in winter, and axial elongation was likewise significantly less in summer. It is unclear whether more time spent outdoors in summer vs. winter is a contributing factor, or the difference in progression rates is a result of ""seasonal"" variations in the intensity or amount of close work performed. These results indicate that studies of potential myopia treatment strategies should be at least 12 months in duration to take seasonal variations into account."
Does ectopic expression of MiR-125a inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting MMP11 and VEGF?,"Decreased miR-125a was observed in both HCC tissues and cell lines, and associated with patients' aggressive pathologic features. Up-regulating miR-125a significantly inhibited the malignant phenotypes by repressing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 11 (MMP11) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, miR-125a expression was inversely correlated with both MMP11 and VEGF-A expression in HCC tissues. Inhibiting miR-125a could increase both MMP11 and VEGF-A expression, and RNA interference targeting MMP11 or VEGF-A mRNA could rescue the loss of miR-125a functions. MiR-125a inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of HCC by targeting MMP11 and VEGF-A. Up-regulation of miR-125a might be a promising approach and a prognostic marker for HCC."

No correlations between adiponectin and insulin levels or insulin resistance were found."
Does comparative genomics of lactic acid bacteria reveal a niche-specific gene set?,"Comparative analysis revealed that if an organism had homologs to the dairy specific geneset, it probably came from a dairy environment, whilst if it had homologs to gut specific genes, it was highly likely to be of intestinal origin.We propose that this ""barcode"" of 9 genes will be a useful initial guide to researchers in the LAB field to indicate an organism's ability to occupy a specific niche."
Do age and violent-content labels make video games forbidden fruits for youth?,"Although the Pan European Game Information system was developed to protect youth from objectionable content, this system actually makes such games forbidden fruits. Pediatricians should be aware of this forbidden-fruit effect, because video games with objectionable content can have harmful effects on children and adolescents."
Is bullying behavior related to suicide attempts but not to self-mutilation among psychiatric inpatient adolescents?,"Among girls, being bullied or bullying others are both potential risk factors for suicidal behavior. Psychiatric assessment and treatment should thus be considered not only for victims of bullying, but also for bullies. Suicide-prevention programs should also routinely include interventions to reduce bullying. However, the generalization of our findings to all adolescents is limited because our study sample consisted of psychiatric adolescent patients. In addition, some of the possible findings might have remained statistically insignificant due to the small sample size among adolescents who had performed suicide attempts or self-mutilation."

Does fDG PET imaging of Ela1-myc mice reveal major biological differences between pancreatic acinar and ductal tumours?,"In Ela1-myc mice, ductal tumours incorporate significantly more FDG than acinar tumours. This difference likely results from differential expression of Glut2 and hexokinases. These findings reveal previously unreported biological differences between acinar and ductal pancreatic tumours."
Is elevated CC chemokine level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid predictive of a poor outcome of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"Elevated levels of CCL2, CCL17 and CCL22 in BAL fluid might be predictive of a poor outcome in patients with IPF."
Does ganglioside GM1 ( porcine ) ameliorate paclitaxel-induced neuropathy in rats?,These data suggest that porcine GM1 may be useful in the prevention and treatment of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. However the adverse effect of Cremophor EL should be of concern.
Do signaling cascades modulate the speed of signal propagation through space?,"Signal speed modulation may be a fundamental function of cascades, affecting the ability of signals to penetrate within a cell, to cross-react with other signals, and to activate distant targets. In particular, enhanced speeds provide a way to increase signal penetration into a cell without needing to flood the cell with large numbers of active signaling molecules; conversely, diminished speeds in zero-order ultrasensitive cascades facilitate strong, but localized, signaling."
Does type of SCN5A mutation determine clinical severity and degree of conduction slowing in loss-of-function sodium channelopathies?,"In loss-of-function SCN5A channelopathies, patients carrying T and M(inactive) mutations develop a more severe phenotype than those with M(active) mutations. This is associated with more severe conduction disorders. This is the first time that genetic data are proposed for risk stratification in BrS."

Are acute effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on attentional control related to antidepressant outcomes?,"Our results should be interpreted as preliminary because our sample was small and because the cognitive task we used has not been tested for validity and reliability. In addition, despite minimal stimulation of the DLPFC during sham stimulation, it is possible that the stimulation was partially active. Finally, benzodiazepines may have had impairing effects on the attentional task."
Does t-cell metagene predict a favorable prognosis in estrogen receptor-negative and HER2-positive breast cancers?,"Precise definitions of the specific subtypes of immune cells in the tumor can be accomplished from microarray data. These surrogate markers define subgroups of tumors with different prognosis. Importantly, all known prognostic gene signatures uniformly assign poor prognosis to all ER-negative tumors. In contrast, the LCK metagene actually separates the ER-negative group into better or worse prognosis."
Does diagnostic ultrasound combined with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-targeted microbubbles improve microvascular recovery after acute coronary thrombotic occlusions?,Intravenous platelet-targeted microbubbles combined with brief high-MI diagnostic ultrasound impulses guided by contrast pulse sequencing improve both epicardial recanalization rates and microvascular recovery.

Is missense single nucleotide polymorphism of the ADAM12 gene associated with radiographic knee osteoarthritis in middle-aged Estonian cohort?,We conclude that rs3740199 polymorphism may affect occurrence of knee OA and its progression. We also hypothesize that the genetic contribution of ADAM12 to OA is remarkably gender-dependent and anatomical site-specific.
Are rigid sigmoidoscopy and MRI interchangeable in determining the position of rectal cancers?,"1) MRI and sigmoidoscopy are not interchangeable in determining the distance from anus to tumour simply by correcting for the length of the anal canal. It has not been determined if measurements from MRI or sigmoidoscopy are more accurate, but current evidence concerning the effect of neoadjuvant irradiation at different positions in the rectum is based upon rigid sigmoidoscopy. 2) The gain in tumour free distance above the anus induced by neoadjuvant treatment is small. Facilitation of sphincter-saving surgery should not be an argument for neoadjuvant treatment."
Does apolipoprotein E modify neurological outcome by affecting cerebral edema but not hematoma size after intracerebral hemorrhage in humans?,The presence of APOE4 is associated with poor functional outcomes in humans after intracerebral hemorrhage. Our data suggest that the mechanism for this may be increased cerebral edema and not larger hematoma volume.
Does dPC4 gene status of the primary carcinoma correlate with patterns of failure in patients with pancreatic cancer?,Pancreatic cancers are represented by distinct genetic subtypes with significantly different patterns of failure. Determinations of DPC4 status at initial diagnosis may be of value in stratifying patients into treatment regimens related to local control versus systemic therapy.

Therefore, IL-6 is essential for SEB-induced Treg insufficiency in nasal polyps."
Is brain maturation delayed in infants with complex congenital heart defects?,"Before surgery, term infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and transposition of the great arteries have brains that are smaller and structurally less mature than expected. This delay in brain development may foster susceptibility to periventricular leukomalacia in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods."
Is early growth response factor-1 associated with intraluminal thrombus formation in human abdominal aortic aneurysm?,The present study demonstrates the differential up-regulation of Egr-1 in the thrombus-covered wall of human AAA and also suggests its possible contribution to the thrombogenic and inflammatory pathogenesis in human AAA.
Does bazedoxifene reduce vertebral and clinical fractures in postmenopausal women at high risk assessed with FRAX?,"Bazedoxifene (20 and 40 mg doses combined) significantly decreased the risk of all clinical fractures and morphometric vertebral fractures in women at or above a FRAX based fracture probability threshold. These results, consistent with the previous subgroup analysis, suggest that bazedoxifene should be targeted preferentially to women at high fracture risk."
Does high glucose sensitize adult cardiomyocytes to ischaemia/reperfusion injury through nitrative thioredoxin inactivation?,High glucose sensitized cardiomyocytes to ischaemia/reperfusion injury through nitrative Trx-1 inactivation. Interventions restoring Trx-1 activity in the diabetic heart may represent novel therapies attenuating cardiac injury in diabetic patients.
Do iBD-associated TL1A gene ( TNFSF15 ) haplotypes determine increased expression of TL1A protein?,"These findings suggest that TL1A gene variation exacerbates induction of TL1A in response to FcgammaR stimulation in Jewish CD patients and this may lead to chronic intestinal inflammation via overwhelming T cell responses. Thus, TL1A may provide an important target for therapeutic intervention in this subgroup of IBD patients."
Does botulinum toxin cosmetic therapy correlate with a more positive mood?,The results support the facial feedback view that frowning can make one unhappier. Treatments that prevent frowning correlate with reduced negative mood.
Does [ Language of instruction and the effect on visual field result ]?,Proper instruction is critical for quality results in perimetry. The study indicated that immigrants would not be handicapped in their performance when given professional instruction in their own language.

Do objective findings with malpositioning of a nucleus 24RE ( CA ) cochlear implant?,"Although the electrode array had folded up on itself during insertion, intraoperative electrode impedances and VIII nerve responses, as well as postoperative electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses, were within normal limits. However, averaged electrode voltages, obtained with the Nucleus Crystal Integrity Test system, were abnormal and consistent with a low-impedance pathway between the apical and middle portions of the electrode array."
Is nadir CA-125 level an independent prognostic factor in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer?,"The prognostic role of the nadir CA-125 is independent of residual tumor size in the patients with advanced EOC. However, it is still unclear whether maximal surgical effort can affect the nadir CA-125 levels."
Does analysis with support vector machine show HIV-positive subjects without infectious retinitis have mfERG deficiencies compared to normal eyes?,"This study confirms that mfERG SOK abnormalities develop in the retina of HIV-positive individuals. The new finding of equal severity of b-latency abnormalities in the low- and high-CD4 groups indicates that good immune status under highly active antiretroviral therapy may not protect against retinal damage and, by extension, damage elsewhere. SOKs are difficult for human experts to interpret. Machine learning classifiers, such as SVM, learn from the data without human intervention, reducing the need to rely on human skills to interpret this test."
Are digital images obtained with a digital camera associated with a loss of critical information -- a preliminary study?,Storing existing radiographs in a digital medium for space saving purposes using a digital camera does not loose critical information.Clinical implication Clinicians can use digital cameras to digitise and store radiographic images without losing important diagnostic information.
Does eWS/ETS regulate the expression of the Dickkopf family in Ewing family tumor cells?,"Our results suggested that DKK2 could not functionally substitute for DKK1 tumor-suppressive effect in EFT. Given the mutually exclusive expression of DKK1 and DKK2, EWS/ETS regulates the transcription of the DKK family, and the EWS/ETS-mediated DKK2 up-regulation could affect the tumorigenicity of EFT in an indirect manner."
Are endometrial osteopontin mRNA expression and plasma osteopontin levels increased in patients with endometriosis?,Osteopontin may be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and plasma OPN may be a useful non-invasive marker for the diagnosis of endometriosis.
"Are changes in endometrial natural killer cell expression of CD94 , CD158a and CD158b associated with infertility?","In infertile women, changes in circulating NK cell percentages are found exclusively during the secretory phase and not in endometrium; cycle-related changes in NK receptor expression are observed only in infertile endometrium. While having exciting implications for understanding NK cell function in fertility, our data emphasize the difficulty in attaching diagnostic or prognostic significance to NK cell analyses in individual patients."
Does glucose modulate event-related potential components of recollection and familiarity in healthy adolescents?,"These findings (a) support the results of previous research that the 'glucose memory facilitation effect' can be extended to healthy adolescents, but (b) suggest that glucose enhances both the recollection and familiarity components of recognition memory. The observed ERP profile has important implications for the proposal that glucose specifically targets the hippocampus in modulating cognitive performance."

These findings may help to identify better methods of preserving brain function and reducing injury during acute hypoglycemia."
Do post-ERCP pancreatitis rates differ between needle-knife and pull-type pancreatic sphincterotomy techniques : a multiendoscopist 13-year experience?,The risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis does not differ between EPS techniques when performed at a high-volume pancreaticobiliary referral center when using routine prophylactic pancreatic duct stent placement.
Does systemic propranolol act centrally to reduce conditioned fear in rats without impairing extinction?,"Propranolol reduced the expression of conditioned fear, without interfering with extinction learning. Reduced fear with intact extinction suggests a possible use for propranolol in reducing anxiety during extinction-based exposure therapies, without interfering with long-term clinical response."
Does appropriate use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure decrease elevated C-reactive protein in patients with obstructive sleep apnea?,"Appropriate use of nCPAP in patients with OSA may be required to decrease elevated CRP levels, with possible implications for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
Is low relative skeletal muscle mass indicative of sarcopenia associated with elevations in serum uric acid levels : findings from NHANES III?,"This study design was limited in its cross-sectional nature. Potential selection, measurement, and recall bias may have occurred, and methodology used to classify sarcopenia status based on skeletal muscle mass index is not validated."
Are low serum carotenoids associated with a decline in walking speed in older women?,"These findings suggest that a higher fruit and vegetable intake, as indicated by higher total serum carotenoid concentrations, may be protective against a decline in walking speed in older women."
"Are genes of cell-cell interactions , chemotherapy detoxification and apoptosis induced during chemotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia?","Pre-apoptotic gene expression can be monitored within hours after start of chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and may be useful in future determination of therapy responders. The low number of patients and the heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukemia limited the identification of gene expression predictive of therapy response. Therapy-induced gene expression reflects the complex biological processes involved in clinical cancer cell eradication and should be explored for future enhancement of therapy."
Does thymidylate synthase gene expression in primary tumors predict activity of s-1-based chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer?,"This study suggests that, via down-regulation of TS by irinotecan treatment, combination chemotherapy with S-1 and irinotecan could be effective in gastric cancer patients with high TS levels."
Does enhancement of the endothelial NO synthase attenuate experimental diastolic heart failure?,"Diastolic dysfunction with increased diastolic stiffness constant and increased left ventricular (LV) pressure was analyzed by invasive pressure-volume loop measurements in the DHF group compared to controls. Cardiac hypertrophy as indicated by LV mass measurements by echocardiography, and increased cardiac collagen content as measured by immunohistochemistry were associated with an increased activation state of calcineurin, AKT, ERK(1/2), but not JNK and p38 kinases. Titin isoforms were not altered in this model of DHF. Treatment with AVE3085 significantly increased eNOS mRNA and protein levels in the cardiac tissue and decreases NAD(P)H oxidase subunits p22phox and gp91phox. Diastolic dysfunction was attenuated and cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were improved in comparison with untreated DHF animals. This was associated with a normalized activation state of calcineurin, AKT and ERK(1/2). Therefore, we suggest that targeting the NO system might yield a future therapeutic aim for the treatment of DHF."
Do simultaneous arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament using hamstring and quadriceps tendon autografts?,Simultaneous arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of both ACL and PCL using hamstring and quadriceps autografts can effectively and safely restore knee stability.
Is childhood sexual abuse associated with physical illness burden and functioning in psychiatric patients 50 years of age and older?,"Strong relationships exist between CSA and medical illness burden, function, and pain among psychiatric patients >or=50 years of age. These relationships cannot be ascribed to shared method variance. Early detection of patients' abuse histories could inform targeted interventions to prevent or decelerate the progression of morbidity in this high-risk group."

When performed in experienced medical centers, RTA may be a valid alternative to conventional treatments for nontoxic and pretoxic TNs. It is particularly attractive for elderly people for whom surgery and radioiodine therapy are often contraindicated or ineffective."
Is more than a decade of iodine prophylaxis needed to eradicate goiter among school age children in a moderately iodine-deficient region?,"The time required to normalize the prevalence of goiter in SAC living in a moderately iodine-deficient environment was at least a decade. To achieve a goiter rate of less than 5% among SAC, it may require that, as a population, they were born and grew up under conditions of iodine sufficiency."
Does the magnitude of increased levothyroxine requirements in hypothyroid pregnant women depend upon the etiology of the hypothyroidism?,The etiology of hypothyroidism plays a pivotal role in determining the timing and magnitude of thyroid hormone adjustments during pregnancy. Patients require vigilant monitoring of thyroid function upon confirmation of conception and anticipatory adjustments to LT(4) dosing based on the etiology of their hypothyroidism.
Does selenium supplementation fail to correct the selenoprotein synthesis defect in subjects with SBP2 gene mutations?,"Total serum Se concentrations in SBP2 deficient subjects respond to selenomethionine supplementation but this effect is not indicative for improved selenoprotein synthesis. Se is obviously not a limiting factor in the SBP2 deficient individuals when regular daily Se intake is provided. These findings might help to identify and diagnose more individuals with selenoprotein biosynthesis defects who might present at young age irrespective of their Se supply with characteristic thyroid function test abnormalities, growth retardation, and reduced Se and selenoprotein concentrations."

Does docosahexaenoic acid suppress arachidonic acid-induced proliferation of LS-174T human colon carcinoma cells?,These results suggest that DHA can inhibit the pro-proliferative effect of abundant AA or PGE(2).
Does the Seattle protocol more reliably predict the detection of cancer at the time of esophagectomy than a less intensive surveillance protocol?,Intense preoperative biopsy sampling by the Seattle protocol does not more reliably predict the detection of cancer at the time of esophagectomy than a less intensive surveillance protocol. This calls into question the concept that extensive sampling with the Seattle protocol consistently detects early cancers arising in Barrett's esophagus patients with high-grade dysplasia.
Does fecal calprotectin predict the clinical course of acute severe ulcerative colitis?,This is the first data set to demonstrate that FC levels are dramatically elevated in severe UC. These data raise the possibility that this biomarker can predict response to first or second-line medical therapy in this setting.

Does gAB2 gene modify the risk of Alzheimer 's disease in Spanish APOE 4 carriers?,GAB2 rs2373115 marker does not modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease in Spanish APOE epsilon 4 carriers.
"Is synapse formation enhanced by oral administration of uridine and DHA , the circulating precursors of brain phosphatides?","Uridine and DHA are circulating precursors for the phosphatides in synaptic membranes, and act in part by increasing the substrate-saturation of enzymes that synthesize phosphatidylcholine from CTP (formed from the uridine, via UTP) and from diacylglycerol species that contain DHA: the enzymes have poor affinities for these substrates, and thus are unsaturated with them, and only partially active, under basal conditions. The enhancement by uridine of neurite outgrowth is also mediated in part by UTP serving as a ligand for neuronal P2Y receptors. Moreover administration of uridine with DHA activates many brain genes, among them the gene for the m-1 metabotropic glutamate receptor [Cansev, et al, submitted]. This activation, in turn, increases brain levels of that gene's protein product and of such other synaptic proteins as PSD-95, synapsin-1, syntaxin-3 and F-actin, but not levels of non-synaptic brain proteins like beta-tubulin. Hence it is possible that giving uridine plus DHA triggers a neuronal program that, by accelerating phosphatide and synaptic protein synthesis, controls synaptogenesis. If administering this mix of phosphatide precursors also increases synaptic elements in brains of patients with Alzheimer 's disease, as it does in normal rodents, then this treatment may ameliorate some of the manifestations of the disease."
Is chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps associated with decreased expression of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper?,Down-regulated expression of GILZ may contribute to the pathogenesis of CRSsNP and CRSwNP and associate with response to surgery.

Does angiotensin AT2 receptor stimulation cause neuroprotection in a conscious rat model of stroke?,"Based on infarct, behavioral, and immunohistochemical data, these results indicate that centrally administered CGP42112 exhibits a neuroprotective effect, which was independent of blood pressure. Thus, for the first time, we have shown that central AT(2)R stimulation is neuroprotective in a conscious rat model of stroke."
Is vascular structure and function correlated to cognitive performance and white matter hyperintensities in older hypertensive patients with subjective memory complaints?,"Our data suggest that vascular abnormalities, independently of blood pressure levels, may play a role in the setting of subjective memory complaints as well as of WMH in elderly hypertensive patients. Arterial thickness and stiffness as well as endothelial function should be assessed simultaneously and may represent additional targets for the prevention of subjective memory complaints and WMH."
Is clinical trial participation associated with improved outcome in women with ovarian cancer?,"Women with ovarian cancer who participate in clinical trials at this institution have improved survival compared with those who are treated with standard therapies. No other factors examined were associated with treatment completion or survival. Further, participation in clinical research does not vary by age, ethnicity, urban versus rural lifestyle, or cancer stage or histologic subtype. However, disclosure of this information to potential clinical trial participants may represent an ethical conflict and should be carefully considered in light of existing ethical guidelines for human subject research."
Does proteasome inhibition promote functional recovery after peripheral nerve reperfusion injury?,"This study indicates that bortezomib; a proteasome inhibitor, is effective at promoting the functional recovery of reperfused peripheral nerve. The proteasome inhibition may play a role as one of the clinical strategy in the peripheral nervous system I/R injury with further understanding its mechanism of action."
Is mF59 emulsion an effective delivery system for a synthetic TLR4 agonist ( E6020 )?,"Combining adjuvants like E6020 and MF59 allowed a finer tuning of the immune response towards a particular Th bias, thus have significant implications for the development of improved influenza vaccines."
Is tissue Doppler imaging measurement of left ventricular systolic function in children : mitral annular displacement index superior to peak velocity?,Displacement index is linearly related to EF and also to other parameters of longitudinal systolic function. Displacement index has some advantages over Sz for assessing ventricular systolic function and should prove useful in measuring longitudinal and global LV systolic function.
Is lacunar stroke associated with diffuse blood-brain barrier dysfunction?,"Patients with lacunar stroke have subtle, diffuse BBB dysfunction in white matter. Further studies are required to determine the relative contributions of BBB dysfunction and/or ischemia to the microvascular and brain abnormalities in lacunar stroke."
Is global leukocyte DNA methylation altered in euthymic bipolar patients?,"The assay we used, based on restriction by methylation-sensitive/insensitive enzymes followed by a radioactive DNA polymerase reaction was approved to accurately measure global DNA methylation, but has technical limitations i.e. restriction enzymes do not cleave all potential methylation sites in the genome and restriction sites may be altered by mutations or polymorphisms."
Does active range of motion predict upper extremity function 3 months after stroke?,Simple AROM measurements of the upper extremity taken within 1 month after stroke can be used to predict upper extremity function at 3 months. This information is important for determining the prognosis of upper extremity functional recovery.
Do posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use disorder in adolescent bipolar disorder?,"An increased rate of PTSD was found in adolescents with BPD. Subjects with both PTSD and BPD developed significantly more subsequent SUD, with BPD, PTSD, then SUD being the most common order of onset. Follow-up studies need to be conducted to elucidate the course and causal relationship of BPD, PTSD and SUD."
Is combinatory inhibition of VEGF and FGF2 superior to solitary VEGF inhibition in an in vitro model of RPE-induced angiogenesis?,RPE from CNV patients expresses angiogenic growth factors that act in part independently of VEGF. Targeted combinatory therapy can be superior to solitary anti-VEGF therapy. One possible candidate for combinatory therapy is FGF2.
Is duration of delayed graft function an important predictor of 1-year serum creatinine?,"We confirmed that 1-year SCr was primarily affected by well-known factors, such as AR incidence, donor age, and female recipient sex. However, we identified DGF duration as a significant factor affecting 1-year SCr. AR rate was also associated with DGF duration, which in turn depended upon longer CIT."
Is magnetic resonance imaging superior to cardiac scintigraphy to identify nonresponders to cardiac resynchronization therapy?,"By SPECT imaging in the DCM group, severe perfusion defects, due to attenuation artifacts, were frequently observed in the LV inferior wall, resulting in the overestimation of scar tissue. CMR identified nonresponders to CRT more reliably than SPECT in patients with DCM."
Is helicobacter pylori infection the major risk factor for atrophic gastritis?,Our results suggest that Hp infection is a stronger predictor than advancing age for atrophic gastritis.
Are urine but not plasma nitric oxide metabolites decreased in women with preeclampsia?,Our study using concomitant measurement of plasma and urine nitrate and nitrite suggests a reduced production of nitric oxide in women with preeclampsia compared with normal pregnant women.
"Is systemic tacrolimus ( FK 506 ) effective for the treatment of psoriasis in a double-blind , placebo-controlled study . The European FK 506 Multicentre Psoriasis Study Group?","Compared with placebo, tacrolimus is efficacious in the treatment of recalcitrant plaque-type psoriasis."

Is low prevalence of depression and anxiety linked to statutory retirement ages rather than personal work exit : a national survey?,"There is a discontinuity in the prevalence of depressive episode for both men and women, coinciding with statutory retirement ages. No studied risk factor reduced the associations between age group and disorders. This population scale recovery may provide a model for understanding non-genetic factors."
Does trp53 loss during in vitro selection contribute to acquired Ara-C resistance in acute myeloid leukemia?,"These data indicate that Trp53 loss-of-function could partly explain the acquisition of AML chemoresistance, and suggest that PFTalpha could be useful in treatment of relapsed AML."
Is metabolomic database annotations via query of elemental compositions : mass accuracy insufficient even at less than 1 ppm?,"More than 1.6 million molecular formulae in the range 0-500 Da were generated in an exhaustive manner under strict observation of mathematical and chemical rules. Assuming that ion species are fully resolved (either by chromatography or by high resolution mass spectrometry), we conclude that a mass spectrometer capable of 3 ppm mass accuracy and 2% error for isotopic abundance patterns outperforms mass spectrometers with less than 1 ppm mass accuracy or even hypothetical mass spectrometers with 0.1 ppm mass accuracy that do not include isotope information in the calculation of molecular formulae."
Does validity of a prescription claim database to estimate medication adherence in older persons?,"The high concordance between prescription claims database and pill counts suggested that the rate with which patients refill their medications usually is consistent with the rate they consume them.

In addition, our method of combining existing data sets can be used to robustly validate the potential clinical value of any new gene expression profile."
Do renal function and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations predict parathyroid hormone levels in renal transplant patients?,"We conclude that 25OHD deficiency and insufficiency are common in renal transplant patients and may exacerbate secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, 25OHD, eGFR and phosphate only account for 19% of the variability in PTH levels. In addition, even a large increase in serum 25OHD levels is likely to result in only a small reduction in PTH. Therefore, alternative approaches to managing hyperparathyroidism in renal transplant recipients rather than supplementation with ergocalciferol are warranted."
Does predictability of the target stimulus for sensory-guided movement modulate early somatosensory cortical potentials?,Sustained attention to task-relevant sensory stimuli differentially modulates areas within primary somatosensory cortex (S1) during a continuous sensory-motor transformation.
Does clotting factor concentrate given to prevent bleeding and bleeding-related complications in people with hemophilia A or B?,"There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether prophylactic clotting factor concentrates decrease bleeding and bleeding-related complications in hemophilia A or B, compared to placebo, on-demand treatment, or prophylaxis based on pharmacokinetic data from individuals. Well-designed RCTs are needed to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic clotting factor concentrates. Two clinical trials are ongoing."
Does chronic ethanol drinking reduce native T-type calcium current in the thalamus of nonhuman primates?,"We conclude that chronic ethanol self-administration reduces calcium currents in thalamic relay cells without altering underlying current kinetics, which may provide a mechanistic framework for the well-documented disruptions in sleep/wake behavior in subjects with chronic ethanol exposure."

Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that cannabis use is a risk factor for full psychosis in this group."
Is conventional MRI inadequate to delineate the relationship between the red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson 's disease?,"Although recent studies imply that the RN can be used as a relatively consistent marker for the position of the STN, the present data suggest otherwise. These data indicate that a single targeting method may be inadequate given the resolution of conventional MRI, and that it is imperative to use multiple anatomical measurements when targeting the STN for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease."
Does automated external defibrillator program impair cardiopulmonary resuscitation initiation in the public access defibrillation trial?,"In the Public Access Defibrillation Trial, rates of CPR actions for presumed OOH-CA victims were low but similar for CPR and CPR+AED responding volunteer rescuers. Factors associated with volunteer response, CPR action initiation, and AED activation warrant further investigation."
Does enhancement of NKT cells and increase in regulatory T cells result in improved allograft survival?,"In our model it appears that a subtherapeutic dose of FK506 enhanced the tolerizing effect of NKT cells induced by oral tolerance, prolonging allograft survival by generating CD25+CD4+ CTLA4 T cells. This appears to be an excellent in vivo model to generate regulatory T cells to allospecific transplant antigens."
Does epigenetic modification of the X chromosome influence susceptibility to polycystic ovary syndrome?,"This study provides evidence to refute the null hypothesis and propose a closer inspection of X-linked genes in PCOS, one in which both genotype and epigenotype are considered. Environmental determinants of PCOS may alter clinical presentation via epigenetic modifications, which currently remain undetected in traditional genetic analyses."

Patients with IBD can be easily trained to use HAT, and patient acceptance is high. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical impact of HAT in IBD."
Does topiramate affect the acquisition or expression of ethanol conditioned place preference in DBA/2J or C57BL/6J mice?,"These findings indicate that topiramate has no effect on ethanol's rewarding or conditioned rewarding effects as indexed by the place conditioning procedure. Thus, these studies raise the possibility that topiramate's efficacy in the treatment of alcoholism results from its impact on brain areas other than those that mediate ethanol's rewarding or conditioned rewarding effects. One alternative possibility is that topiramate decreases withdrawal-induced negative affective states that normally contribute to relapse."
Does methylphenidate improve aspects of executive function in African American children with ADHD?,"Similar to previous findings with predominantly majority samples of patients with ADHD, MPH enhances planning, precision, and persistence in African American children with ADHD."
Is primary care patients ' involvement in decision-making associated with improvement in depression?,Depressed patients with higher ratings of involvement in medical decisions have a higher probability of receiving guideline-concordant care and improving their symptoms over an 18-month period. Interventions to increase patient involvement in decision-making may be an important means of improving care for and outcomes of depression.
Is the child perception questionnaire valid for malocclusions in the United Kingdom?,"CPQ(11-14) has acceptable reliability and validity, and is likely to be a useful measure for orthodontic trials. The impact of malocclusion on a child's quality of life might be substantial."
Is urinary beta2-microglobulin associated with acute renal allograft rejection?,"Beta2-microglobulin could be a strong biomarker for AR if used in conjunction with other biomarkers, producing an AR-specific urinary protein signature. This possibility must be confirmed in a larger cohort of kidney transplant recipients."
Is suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid effective in preclinical studies of medulloblastoma?,"SAHA effectively induces cell death in established medulloblastoma cell lines, human patient primary tumor cultures, medulloblastoma xenografts and intracranial spontaneous medulloblastomas. Fibroblasts in culture and mice treated with SAHA did not reveal prohibitive toxicity profiles. These findings support the advancement of SAHA to pediatric clinical trials."

Rather, they are most strongly linked with many subjective psychosocial variables."
Do human airway and peripheral blood eosinophils enhance Th1 and Th2 cytokine secretion?,"Our data demonstrate that SEB-induced generation of Th1 and Th2 cytokines is increased in the presence of human blood and airway eosinophils. Thus, eosinophils can have an immunoregulatory function in pathogen-associated allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis, chronic sinusitis, and asthma exacerbations."
Do positive symptoms and duration of illness predict functional laterality and attention modulation in schizophrenia?,"Positive symptoms predicted reduced functional laterality, suggesting involvement of left temporal lobe language processing. Duration of illness predicted impaired attention modulation, possibly reflecting the involvement of frontotemporal networks."
Do notochord cells regulate intervertebral disc chondrocyte proteoglycan production and cell proliferation?,"The biology of the disc-derived chondrocyte is profoundly affected by NCCM in that various concentrations of NCCM activate proteoglycan production in a dose-dependent fashion. However, in the doses tested in our study, cell proliferation was increased but in a nondose-dependent fashion. Notochord cells retain their phenotype even in monolayer and through the development of floating intimately associated masses of cells suggest the development and maintenance of cell-cell interaction. These masses of cells are retained even after 6 days in culture when they do attach to the tissue plate surface. The persistence of notochord cells in non-chondrodystrophic dog species suggests that these in vitro studies may mirror the milieu of the disc in vivo, in which the notochord cell may play a key role in disc homeostasis."
Is protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B involved in neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer?,"Our findings suggest that PTP1B plays an important role in neuroendocrine differentiation, and therefore, may possibly be involved in the progression of prostate cancer."
"Are pAPP-A and osteoprotegerin , together with interleukin-8 and RANTES , elevated in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis?","Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A and osteoprotegerin may play a role in the inflammation process of endometriosis, but interleukin-8 and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted are superior peritoneal fluid markers."
Do a randomized trial of the anti-depressant effects of low- and high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation in treatment-resistant depression?,HFL-rTMS and LFR-rTMS appear to be equally efficacious in treating major depression. This study adds to the growing literature supporting LFR-rTMS as an additional viable method of rTMS delivery in the treatment of depression.
Does varus alignment lead to increased forces in the anterior cruciate ligament?,"There is a direct relationship between varus alignment and anterior cruciate ligament tension. In the absence of an anterior cruciate ligament, the amount of lateral opening tends to increase. With increasing lateral opening, a thrust can sometimes be experimentally observed."
Does in vitro evaluation of the precision of working cast for implant-supported restoration with multiple abutments?,There was no statistical difference between the two methods studied.

Does intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury trigger activation of innate toll-like receptor 4 and adaptive chemokine programs?,"This study is the first to demonstrate increased expression of TLR4 and NF-kappaB after warm intestinal IRI. This detrimental cascade may be initiated by TLR4 via NF-kappaB signaling pathways, implicating TLR4 as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of intestinal IRI."
Does immunosuppression associated with interleukin-1R-associated-kinase-M upregulation predict mortality in Gram-negative sepsis ( melioidosis )?,Immunosuppression in sepsis caused by B. pseudomallei is associated with an upregulation of IRAK-M and an indicator of poor outcome.
Does cPAP therapy of obstructive sleep apnea in type 2 diabetics improve glycemic control during sleep?,"Our study is limited by the lack of a control group, but the results suggest that sleeping glucose levels decrease and are more stable after patients with type 2 diabetes and OSA are treated with CPAP."
Is gene expression in human chondrocytes in late osteoarthritis changed in both fibrillated and intact cartilage without evidence of generalised chondrocyte hypertrophy?,"The expression of key chondrocyte genes, including aggrecan and SOX9, was decreased in OA cartilage and the changes were similar in both fibrillated high-loaded and intact low-loaded cartilage on the same joint. However, there was no significant upregulation of type X collagen, and other genes associated with chondrocyte further differentiation and hypertrophy."
Does protein expression profiling in esophageal adenocarcinoma patients indicate association of heat-shock protein 27 expression and chemotherapy response?,"Albeit preliminary, our encouraging data suggest that protein expression profiling may distinguish cancers with a different response to chemotherapy. Our results suggest that response to chemotherapy may be related to a different activation of stress response and inflammatory biology in general. Moreover, the potential of HSPs and GRPs as biomarkers of chemotherapy response warrants further validation."
Is fgf2 expressed in human and murine embryonic choroid plexus and affects choroid plexus epithelial cell behaviour?,"Fgf2 expression early in the development of both human and rodent choroid plexus, and its ability to modulate behaviour and gene expression in CPe, supports the view that Fgf signalling plays a role in the maintenance of integrity and function of this specialized epithelium, and that this role is conserved between rodents and humans."
Does nogo-A inhibitory peptide ( NEP1-40 ) increase pan-cadherin expression following mild cortical contusion injury in rats?,We observed improved preservation of injured neurons after topical application of NEP 1-40 following mild cortical injury. Pan-cadherin expression may correlate with the recovery of neurons and axonal bodies. Electron microscopical findings confirmed better preservation of neuronal structures after NEP1-40 treatment. Pan-cadherin is a good marker for neuronal recovery after cortical injury.
"Are class I histone deacetylases 1 , 2 and 3 highly expressed in renal cell cancer?","Class I HDAC isoforms 1 and 2 are highly expressed in renal cell cancer, while HDAC 3 shows low, histology dependent expression rates. These unexpected differences in the expression patterns suggests alternative regulatory mechanisms of class I HDACs in renal cell cancer and should be taken into account when trials with isoform selective HDI are being planned. Whether HDAC expression in renal cancers is predictive of responsiveness for HDI will have to be tested in further studies."
Does goal achievement provide new insights into interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome symptoms and outcomes?,Patients have individualized treatment goals. GAS holds promise for addressing individuality in a standardized format. A new instrument developed from this work is being piloted in a multicenter RCT. We also suggest that questionnaires investigating urgency in IC/PBS clarify the definition in a way more applicable to the specific condition.
Do moulage in high-fidelity simulation-a chest wall burn escharotomy model for visual realism and as an educational tool?,"In the case of the chest wall burn model, moulage was used as more than a visual realism enhancing strategy-it served as an educational tool in its own right, permitting demonstration of a procedure performed infrequently outside the walls of major burns centers."
Does upregulation of CRABP1 in human neuroblastoma cells overproducing the Alzheimer-typical Abeta42 reduce their differentiation potential?,"We conclude that increasing the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio up-regulates CRABP1, which in turn reduces the differentiation potential of the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, but increases cell proliferation. This work might contribute to the better understanding of AD neurogenesis, currently a controversial topic."
Does an expression meta-analysis of predicted microRNA targets identify a diagnostic signature for lung cancer?,"This study focuses on predicted targets of three lung-enriched miRNAs, compares their expression patterns in lung cancer by their GO terms, and identifies a minimal set of genes differentially expressed in AD and SCC, followed by validating this gene signature in multiple published datasets. Expression of this gene signature in bronchial epithelial cells of cigarette smokers also has a great sensitivity to predict the patients having lung cancer if combined with cytopathology of the cells."
Does duration of untreated psychosis and it 's effect on the symptomatic recovery in schizophrenia - preliminary results?,Better outcome can be achieved with early antipsychotic treatment. Patients with long DUP differ from patients who were treated already in the prodromal phase in several outcome measures.
Does fecal calprotectin complement routine laboratory investigations in diagnosing childhood inflammatory bowel disease?,Calprotectin is significantly more likely to be raised than any commonly employed blood tests at IBD diagnosis. When used in combination with these bloods tests an abnormality was demonstrated in 1 or both tests in all patients at diagnosis in this study. Fecal calprotectin measurement is a significant advance when used contemporaneously and in addition to a routine panel of blood tests in the diagnosis of pediatric IBD.
Does trazodone improve the results of cognitive behaviour therapy of primary insomnia in non-depressed patients?,"CBT, singly and combined with the sedative antidepressant trazodone, is effective for the short-term management of chronic primary insomnia. Trazodone combined with CBT significantly increases slow wave sleep duration and this influence seems to be unrelated to its antidepressant effect."
Does quantification of SLIT-ROBO transcripts in hepatocellular carcinoma reveal two groups of genes with coordinate expression?,"The present study is the first in comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of SLIT-ROBO family gene expression in HCC, and suggests that the expression of SLIT-ROBO genes is regulated in hepatocarcinogenesis. Our results implicate that SLIT-ROBO transcription profile is bi-modular in nature, and that each module shows intrinsic variability. We also provide quantitative evidence for potential use of ROBO1, ROBO4 and SLIT2 for prediction of tumor stage and differentiation status."
Does memantine induce reversible neurologic impairment in patients with MS?,Memantine at a dose of 30 mg/day may induce transient worsening of neurologic symptoms of multiple sclerosis.

Does transplantation of human mesenchymal stem cells into intervertebral discs in a xenogeneic porcine model?,hMSCs survive in the porcine disc for at least 6 months and express typical chondrocyte markers suggesting differentiation toward disc-like cells. As in autologous animal models the combination with a three-dimensional-hydrogel carrier seems to facilitate differentiation and survival of MSCs in the disc. Xenotransplantation seems to be valuable in evaluating the possibility for human cell therapy treatment for intervertebral discs.
Does ten years of growth hormone ( GH ) replacement normalize muscle strength in GH-deficient adults?,"Ten years of GH replacement therapy increased muscle strength during the first half of the study and thereafter partly protected against the normal age-related decline in muscle strength and neuromuscular function, resulting in approximately normalized muscle strength after 10 yr."
Do surgeon 's expectations predict the outcome of a total knee arthroplasty?,The outcome of a TKA depends on multiple factors. Both the surgeon's preoperative assessment of the difficulty and the surgeon's immediate postoperative satisfaction do not independently predict the outcome of a TKA.
Does microarray-based approach identify microRNAs and their target functional patterns in polycystic kidney disease?,We find that the functional patterns of predicted miRNA targets and differentially expressed mRNAs are similar. Our results suggest an important role of miRNAs in specific pathways underlying PKD.
Is true ovarian volume underestimated by two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound measurement?,Ovarian volume was severely underestimated by transvaginal 2D ultrasound measurement.
Does swiss tertiary care center experience challenge the age-cohort effect in Helicobacter pylori infection?,Epidemiologic characteristics of H. pylori infection in Western countries are influenced by changing demographics. Further studies are warranted to investigate reasons for the changing trends in the prevalence of H. pylori infection.
Is pathology alleviated by doxycycline in a laminin-alpha2-null model of congenital muscular dystrophy?,Doxycycline or other drugs with similar functional profiles may be a possible route to improving neuromuscular dysfunction caused by laminin-alpha2-deficiency.
Do comparative kinomics of human and chimpanzee reveal unique kinship and functional diversity generated by new domain combinations?,"Though the chimpanzee and human are evolutionary very close, there are chimpanzee kinases with no close counterpart in the human suggesting differences in their functions. This analysis provides a direction for experimental analysis of human and chimpanzee protein kinases in order to enhance our understanding on their specific biological roles."
Does cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 promoter -658CT gene polymorphism is associate with ulcerative colitis in Chinese patients?,The T allele of CTLA-4 -658 polymorphism in the promoter of CTLA-4 gene was highly associated with UC in the Han Chinese in central China.
Does poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase inhibition counteract cataract formation and early retinal changes in streptozotocin-diabetic rats?,PARP activation is implicated in the formation of diabetic cataract and in early retinal changes. These findings provide a rationale for the development of PARP inhibitors for the prevention of diabetic ocular complications.
Are polymorphisms in the interleukin-10 gene cluster possibly involved in the increased risk for major depressive disorder?,"Our study established increased risk for MDD related to the IL20 and IL24 haplotype and suggests that cytokines may contribute to the pathogenesis of MDD. Since none of the block 2 SNPs were individually associated with MDD, it is possible that other polymorphisms linked to them contribute to the disease susceptibility. Future studies are needed to confirm the results and to find the possible functional explanation."
"Is normalization of leaky gut in chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) accompanied by a clinical improvement : effects of age , duration of illness and the translocation of LPS from gram-negative bacteria?","The results show that normalization of the IgA and IgM responses to translocated LPS may predict clinical outcome in CFS. The results support the view that a weakened tight junction barrier with subsequent gut-derived inflammation is a novel pathway in CFS and that it is a new target for drug development in CFS. Meanwhile, CFS patients with leaky gut can be treated with specific NAIOSs and a leaky gut diet."
Is pleocytosis associated with disruption of HIV compartmentalization between blood and cerebral spinal fluid viral populations?,"Inflammation in the CNS, marked by pleocytosis, allows HIV populations to mix between blood and CSF, which may increase the overall viral genetic diversity within the CSF."
Does perianal disease predict changes in Crohn 's disease phenotype-results of a population-based study of inflammatory bowel disease phenotype?,"Although CD location remains relatively stable, behavior changes over time. Perianal disease is a strong predictor of developing more complicated CD. Proctitis is most common in UC patients at diagnosis although younger patients are more likely than older patients to have extensive disease. The Montreal classification provides a clinically useful framework for both researchers and clinicians."
Do respiratory cycle-related EEG changes during sleep reflect esophageal pressures?,"Variation within subjects of sigma RCREC with APes supports previous evidence that RCREC within this range may reflect microarousals exacerbated by increased work of breathing. Correlation of beta and theta, but not sigma RCREC with deltaPes in between-subject comparisons is more difficult to explain but suggests that ranges other than sigma also deserve further investigation for clinical utility."
"Is the effect of growth hormone treatment on metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors similar in preterm and term short , small for gestational age children?","The effect of GH treatment on metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors is similar in preterm and term short, SGA children."
Is differential regulation of aortic growth in male and female rodents associated with AAA development?,"This study documents a decrease in AAA diameter in males treated with estrogen or undergoing orchiectomy, but no changes in females treated with testosterone or undergoing oophorectomy; and an increase in diameter in MOT and a decrease in FOE. These data suggest that gonadal hormones differentially regulate AAA growth in association with changes in macrophages."
Do referral letters for 2-week wait suspected colorectal cancer allow a 'straight-to-test ' pathway?,"A significant number of patients would have had tests changed after a clinical consultation. However, only a small number required further investigations having had a consultation prior to their initial investigations. We conclude that 2-week wait suspected colorectal cancer patients should be seen in the clinic first and should not proceed 'straight-to-test'."
Does the inhibition of the highly expressed miR-221 and miR-222 impair the growth of prostate carcinoma xenografts in mice?,These findings suggest that modulating miR-221/222 levels may have a therapeutic potential in prostate carcinoma.
Is acute doxorubicin cardiotoxicity associated with p53-induced inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway?,"These data suggest that doxorubicin treatment induces acute cardiac dysfunction and reduces cardiac mass via p53-dependent inhibition of mTOR signaling and that loss of myocardial mass, and not cardiomyocyte apoptosis, is the major contributor to acute doxorubicin cardiotoxicity."
Does proteomic analysis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha resistant human breast cancer cells reveal a MEK5/Erk5-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype?,"This study demonstrates that MEK5 over-expression promotes a TNF-alpha resistance phenotype associated with distinct proteomic changes (upregulation of VIM/vim, GSTP1/gstp1, and CKB/ckb; and downregulation of KRT8/krt8, KRT19/krt19, and GSTM3/gstm3). We further demonstrate that MEK5-mediated progression to an EMT phenotype is dependent upon intact Erk5 and associated with upregulation of SNAI2 and ZEB1 expression."
Do better estimation of protein-DNA interaction parameters improve prediction of functional sites?,"We think that training binding site detection algorithms on datasets from binding assays lead to better prediction. The improvements in accuracy came from the unbiased nature of the SELEX dataset rather than from the number of sites available. We believe that with progress in short-read sequencing technology, one could use SELEX methods to characterize binding affinities of many low specificity transcription factors."
Does a regional system of stroke care provide thrombolytic outcomes comparable with the NINDS stroke trial?,"During a 9-year period, an emergency medicine network with stroke consultants achieved patient outcomes comparable to those reported from the NINDS trial. These results indicate that the NINDS tPA protocol is applicable to community practice, with the support of a university-based brain attack center."
"Is plum juice , but not dried plum powder , effective in mitigating cognitive deficits in aged rats?",These results are discussed in relation to the amount and type of phenolics present in the plum products and in relation to other dietary intervention studies in which cognitive benefits have been reported.
Does development of computerized alert with management strategies for 25 serious drug-drug interactions?,"To ensure that clinicians, when confronted with any of 25 serious DDIs in the ambulatory care setting, can avoid these DDIs while treating patients with appropriate medications, management strategies were developed using a consensus approach. Several methods were used to ensure that the recommended alternatives were truly safe. Four well-established drug-interaction compendia were screened, and any potential alternative agent that was listed as having an interaction (moderate or serious in nature) was excluded from the list of alternative agents. Case reports, case series, and clinical studies that focused on the alternative combinations were reviewed to determine if the alternative posed interaction risks. If an interaction for the alternative combination had not been identified in the compendia or in the literature search, other potential mechanisms for drug interactions were explored such as alterations in absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion. Pharmacology and therapeutics textbooks and other drug information sources also served as resources. In general, the strategies included alternatives to both medications, changing dosage or increasing monitoring of one of the agents, situations where one of the medications had no alternative but alternatives were available for the other medication, and alternative methods of birth control. In some situations the two drugs were contraindicated, while in others the two drugs should be avoided if at all possible and alternatives used."
Does cerebral oxygen desaturation predict cognitive decline and longer hospital stay after cardiac surgery?,Intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation is significantly associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and prolonged hospital stay after CABG.
Does comparison of two VA laboratory data repositories indicate that missing data vary despite originating from the same source?,"Six of the laboratory tests demonstrated remarkably similar amounts of overlap, though Immunology Case Registry and Decision Support System both have missing data. Findings indicate that validation of laboratory data should be conducted before its use in quality and efficiency projects. When 2 databases are not available for comparison, other methods of validation should be implemented."
Do dNA copy-number alterations underlie gene expression differences between microsatellite stable and unstable colorectal cancers?,Our results show cross-study consistency of MSI-associated gene expression changes in colorectal cancers. DNA copy-number alterations partly cause the differences in gene expression between MSI and MSS cancers.
Does gray matter atrophy correlate with MS disability progression measured with MSFC but not EDSS?,"Whole brain, GM, and WM atrophy predicted MS disability progression observed over the next 6.6 years. Gray matter atrophy rates over 4 years correlated with disability progression measured with the MSFC, but not EDSS. This indicates that MSFC defined disability progression is more closely linked to brain atrophy than EDSS defined disability progression, and provides important new insight into the poor correlation between MRI and clinical disability in MS. The findings confirm the clinical relevance of gray matter atrophy in MS."
Do human uterine NK cells interact with uterine macrophages via NKG2D upon stimulation with PAMPs?,This study demonstrates that the NKG2D-MICA interaction is an important molecular mechanism that is involved in the innate immune response to microbial signals in the human uterine endometrium.
Is predisposition to vitamin D deficiency osteomalacia and rickets in females linked to their 25 ( OH ) D and calcium intake rather than vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism?,"Among the immediate family members of patients with OSM/rickets, female sibs have features of biochemical OSM in up to 24.4%. Female sibs, unlike male sibs, share with patients features of markedly low serum 25(OH)D levels, poor dietary calcium intake and poor exposure to sunshine. Genetic factors such as VDR and PTH gene SNPs were not associated with OSM/rickets."
Does acetyl-Ile-Gly-Leu protect neurons from Abeta ( 1-42 ) induced toxicity in vitro and in V337M human tau-expressing mice?,"These results suggest that a modified tripeptide, acetyl-IGL, may be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."

Knowledge of important proteins in such pathways enables identification of appropriate 'co-targets', best examples being RecA, Rv0823c, Rv0892 and DnaE1, for drugs targeting the mycolic acid pathway. Insights obtained about the propensity of a drug to trigger resistance will be useful both for more careful identification of drug targets as well as to identify target-co-target pairs, both implementable in early stages of drug discovery itself. This approach is also inherently generic, likely to significantly impact drug discovery."
Does donor blood glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency reduce the efficacy of exchange transfusion in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia?,Exchange transfusion with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient donor blood leads to a lesser drop in postexchange total serum bilirubin. It prolongs the duration of phototherapy and increases the need for repeat exchange transfusions.
Does therapeutic hypothermia preserve antioxidant defenses after severe traumatic brain injury in infants and children?,"To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that hypothermia attenuates oxidative stress after severe TBI in infants and children. Our data also support the concept that CSF represents a valuable tool for monitoring treatment effects on oxidative stress after TBI."

Does a novel mutation in BBS7 gene cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome in a Chinese family?,This study describes a novel mutation in BBS7 causing BBS in a Chinese family. This is the first report that a mutation in a BBS gene causes BBS in a Chinese population. These results expand the spectrum of human disease associated with mutations of BBS7 since the initial three mutations in BBS7 were first identified in 2003.
Does global expression profiling in atopic eczema reveal reciprocal expression of inflammatory and lipid genes?,"Through genome-wide expression profiling, we were able to discover a distinct reciprocal expression pattern of induced inflammatory genes and repressed lipid metabolism genes in skin from AE patients. We found a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in AE with cytobands associated to the disease, and furthermore new chromosomal regions were found that could potentially guide future region-specific linkage mapping in AE. The full data set is available at http://microarray-pubs.stanford.edu/eczema."
Do traditional clinical risk assessment tools accurately predict coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden : a CT angiography study?,"Coronary risk stratification using a risk factor only-based scheme is a weak discriminator of the overall atherosclerotic plaque burden in individual patients. Patients with little or no plaque might be subjected to lifelong drug therapy, whereas many others with substantial plaque might be undertreated or not treated at all."
Do early post operative visual outcome in microsurgically treated suprasellar meningiomas predict long-term visual outcome?,Visual outcome is better in patients with preoperative vision > 1 mfc and early post-operative vision significantly correlates with long term visual outcome.
Does protein modification respond to exercise intensity and antioxidant supplementation?,These results indicate that CP concentrations increase with 80% .VO2max intensity. The JPC group had lower baseline CP levels after 16 and 28 wk and no exercise-induced CP increase. HSA is reversibly shifted to a more oxidized state by recent intense exercise.

Do development and validation of a model for prediction of mortality in patients with acute burn injury?,An accurate model was developed to predict the probability of death from acute burn injury based on simple and objective clinical criteria.
Is understanding of anesthesia machine function enhanced with a transparent reality simulation?,"Schematic simulations that transparently allow learners to visualize, and explore, underlying system dynamics and relations among components may provide a more effective mental model for certain systems. This may lead to a deeper understanding of how the system works, and therefore, we believe, how to detect and respond to potentially adverse situations."
Do medical students learn over distance using virtual reality simulation?,"These findings suggest the feasibility and acceptability by students in the use of VR simulation integrated into a PBL learning session, as well as multipoint distance technologies that allowed interaction between students and tutors in different locations. The authors believe that these modalities can be applied where students and tutors from different institutions are in separate locations and can be used to support interactive experiential learning in a distributed network or on site and suggest areas for additional research."
Is neonatal high pressure hydrocephalus associated with elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IFNgamma in cerebrospinal fluid?,"Independent of the pathogenesis, neonatal HPHC is associated with the activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-18 and IFNgamma) in the CSF, whereas CSF apoptosis biomarkers (sFasL) were unchanged. This suggests that anti-inflammatory treatment (in addition to shunting) could be helpful to preserve cerebral white matter."
Do hemangioblasts from human embryonic stem cells generate multilayered blood vessels with functional smooth muscle cells?,These results demonstrate that hemangioblasts (BCs) generated from hESCs are tripotential and can provide a potentially inexhaustible source of cells for the treatment of human blood and vascular diseases.
Does ultrasonic cardiac output monitor provide accurate measurement of cardiac output in recipients after liver transplantation?,"This is the first study to evaluate the accuracy of USCOM in the post-liver transplant setting. This device is accurate in measuring CO in liver transplant recipients postoperatively. Possible risks of arrhythmia, infection and pulmonary artery rupture can be avoided because of its noninvasive nature. USCOM should be considered as an alternative in hemodynamic monitoring after liver transplantation."

"Is beta-catenin involved in N-cadherin-dependent adhesion , but not in canonical Wnt signaling in E2A-PBX1-positive B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells?","Wnt16 does not activate canonical Wnt signaling in E2A-PBX1-positive cells. Instead, beta-catenin is involved in N-cadherin-dependent adherence junctions, suggesting for the first time that leukemia-stroma interactions may be mediated via an N-cadherin-dependent mechanism."
Is reduced fronto-temporal connectivity associated with frontal gray matter density reduction and neuropsychological deficit in schizophrenia?,"Our data support the disconnectivity hypothesis in schizophrenia, enlightening a link between reduced fronto-temporal connectivity and ""frontal"" cognitive deficits. Reduced gray matter density may be involved primarily in the pathogenesis of some of these disconnected areas."
Do dynamic preload indicators fail to predict fluid responsiveness in open-chest conditions?,"Our results suggest that the dynamic preload indicators PPV and SVV are able to predict fluid responsiveness under closed-chest conditions, whereas all static and dynamic preload indicators fail to predict fluid responsiveness under open-chest conditions."
Is opposing effects of sirtuins on neuronal survival : SIRT1-mediated neuroprotection independent of its deacetylase activity?,"Overall, our study makes three contributions - (a) it represents the first analysis of SIRT3-7 in the regulation of neuronal survival, (b) it shows that neuroprotection by SIRT1 can be mediated by a novel, non-catalytic mechanism, and (c) that subcellular localization may be an important determinant in the effect of SIRT5 on neuronal viability."
Are twenty-four-month postradiation prostate biopsies strongly predictive of 7-year disease-free survival : results from a Canadian randomized trial?,Two-year post-RT prostate biopsies were strongly predictive of subsequent DFS. Biopsies with severe treatment effect were considered negative.
"Are high mean platelet volume , low-grade systemic coagulation and fibrinolytic activation associated with androgen and insulin levels in polycystic ovary syndrome?","PCOS patients had low-grade systemic coagulation and fibrinolytic activation as evidenced by elevated D-dimer, and increased WBC and MPV levels suggesting that hematological parameters could potentially be used as indicators of risk factor for atherosclerosis in PCOS women."
Are overweight and obesity in old age associated with greater dementia risk?,Older persons with higher BMI scores have less dementia risk than their counterparts with lower BMI scores. High BMI scores in late life should not necessarily be considered to be a risk factor for dementia.
Is arm use after left or right hemiparesis influenced by hand preference?,"These findings emphasize the influence of hand preference on arm use after stroke for the ipsilesional but not the contralesional arm. Although both stroke groups used their ipsilesional more than their contralesional arm, the difference was greater for the right hemisphere damage group who used their ipsilesional arm 4 times more frequently than their contralesional arm, whereas the left hemisphere damage group used their ipsilesional arm 2 times more frequently than their contralesional arm."
Does microarray RNA expression analysis of cerebral white matter lesions reveal changes in multiple functional pathways?,"WML represent areas with a complex molecular phenotype. From this and previous evidence, WML may arise through tissue ischemia but may also reflect the contribution of additional factors like blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Differential expression of genes in WM[L] compared to WM[C] indicate a ""field effect"" in the seemingly normal surrounding white matter."
Does serum alpha-fetoprotein level per tumor volume reflect prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after curative hepatectomy?,"AFP/volume represents a better prognostic indicator for patients with HCC than serum AFP value alone. In particular, patients with AFP/volume > 20.0 are likely to experience recurrence within 6 months after curative hepatectomy."
Does a new PET scanner with semiconductor detectors enable better identification of intratumoral inhomogeneity?,"These phantom and clinical studies suggested that this new PET scanner has the potential for better identification of intratumoral inhomogeneity, probably because of its high spatial resolution and low scatter noise."
Does whole genome-expression profiling reveal a role for immune and inflammatory response in abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture?,The differential expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses was confirmed at AAA rupture site. These genes may represent novel targets for treatment of aneurysms.
Does gene expression meta-analysis identify metastatic pathways and transcription factors in breast cancer?,By pathway meta-analysis many biological mechanisms beyond major characteristics such as proliferation are identified. Transcription factor analysis identifies a number of key factors that support central pathways. Several previously proposed treatment targets are identified and several new pathways that may constitute new targets are identified.

Does microvessel density correlate with lymph node metastases and prognosis in hilar cholangiocarcinoma?,"Neovascularization is associated with nodal spread as well as local recurrence and serves as an independent prognostic factor for survival after curative resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Therefore, tumor-associated neovascularization seems to be critically involved in the progression of this tumor entity. In addition, neovascularization may represent a potential target in he development of new therapeutic approaches in hilar cholangiocarcinoma."
Does sustained replication in endometrium of women with endometriosis occur without evoking a DNA damage response?,These findings demonstrate that the state of replication seen in secretory phase endometrium from women with active peritoneal endometriosis is not a simple extension of the proliferative phase.
Does 24-h smoking abstinence potentiate fMRI-BOLD activation to smoking cues in cerebral cortex and dorsal striatum?,"The present findings indicate that smoking abstinence significantly potentiates neural responses to smoking-related cues in brain regions subserving visual sensory processing, attention, and action planning. Moreover, greater abstinence-induced craving was significantly correlated with increased smoking cue activation in dmPFC areas involved in action planning and decision making. These findings suggest that drug abstinence can increase the salience of conditioned cues, which is consistent with incentive-motivation models of addiction."
Does eUS clarify the natural history and ideal management of GISTs?,EUS elucidates GIST natural history and can help guide management. GISTs larger than 17 mm should be monitored by EUS and considered for more aggressive treatment. Searching for synchronous tumors in patients with GISTs should be considered.

Thus, intestinal expression in UGCs is not useful as a marker of tumour progression because it is also affected by environmental factors and genetic lineage."
"Is for patients with predicted low risk for choledocholithiasis undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy , selective intraoperative cholangiography and postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography an effective strategy to limit unnecessary procedures?","For patients who underwent LC, we performed selective IOC with postoperative ERCP for positive studies. Review of our experience using this algorithm showed it to be a powerful tool in limiting unnecessary ERCPs. Our data suggest that routine preoperative ERCP cannot be justified. Selective IOC during LC misses relatively few cases of biliary stones; these can be managed quickly by experienced endoscopists."
Does dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine ameliorate scopolamine-induced impairment of spatial learning and memory by targeting alpha7 nicotinic ACh receptors?,"The results of the present study show that DLPhtCho improves scopolamine-induced learning and memory deficits, possibly by facilitating hippocampal synaptic transmission under the control of alpha7 ACh receptors. DLPhtCho, therefore, could be developed as a beneficial anti-dementia drug."
Does targeting heat-shock protein 90 improve efficacy of rapamycin in a model of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice?,"Blocking Hsp90 disrupts rapamycin-induced activation of alternative signaling pathways in HCCs and substantially improves the growth-inhibitory effects of mTOR inhibition in vivo. Hence, the concept of targeting tumor cells, ECs, and VSMCs by blocking Hsp90/mTOR could prove valuable for treatment of HCC."

Rocker-formed spheroids appear suitable for application in a bioartificial liver or as an in vitro liver tissue construct.
Do early changes in tumor size in patients treated for advanced stage nonsmall cell lung cancer correlate with survival?,"There is no evidence of a relation between early changes in tumor size and survival among patients with advanced stage NSCLC. To predict survival in patients with advanced NSCLC, response criteria other than change in lesion size are needed."
Do circulating markers of endothelial dysfunction interact with proteinuria in predicting mortality in renal transplant recipients?,"In RTR, UPE is correlated with sVCAM-1 but not with sICAM-1. Furthermore, RTR with proteinuria and high concentrations of sICAM-1 or sVCAM-1 have an increased risk for death, compared with RTR without proteinuria, whereas this is not the case in RTR with proteinuria but low concentrations of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1. These results suggest that ED plays a role in the association of proteinuria with mortality after renal transplantation."
Do validation for quantification of immunoglobulins by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry?,"Together with PLS analysis, FT-IR spectrometry appears to be an easy-to-use and accurate method to determine multianalyte concentrations in dried human plasma.

The subset of children with BI and enhanced response monitoring might face greater risk for later-life clinical anxiety than children with either BI or enhanced response monitoring alone.
Do incidence and indications for revision cochlear implant surgery in adults and children?,"Revision cochlear implant surgery is an infrequent occurrence. Its incidence appears to be higher in children than in adults, although in this series does not appear to be due to increased wound complications, infections, or trauma. Explanted implants that have soft failure as the etiology may have demonstrable defects on bench testing."
Does prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis longer than 24 hours decrease surgical site infection after elective gastric and colorectal surgery?,"From our findings, SSI rate did not decrease with longer duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis. We concluded that we must recognize that the cause of postoperative wound infection is multimodal, and should not rely on antibiotics to prevent postoperative SSI but that surgeons should reduce the risk for postoperative SSI."
Does interactive video instruction improve the quality of dispatcher-assisted chest compression-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation in simulated cardiac arrests?,"The addition of interactive video communication to dispatcher-assisted chest compression-only CPR initially delayed the commencement of chest compressions, but subsequently improved the depth and rate of compressions. The benefit was achieved mainly through real-time feedback."

Do flanking signal and mature peptide residues influence signal peptide cleavage?,"We conclude that the peptide segment recognized by SPase I extends to the start of the mature protein to a limited extent, upon our survey of the amino acid residues surrounding the cleavage processing site. These flanking residues possibly influence the cleavage processing and contribute to non-canonical cleavage sites. Our findings are applicable in defining more accurate prediction tools for recognition and identification of cleavage site of SPs."
Does inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA enhance the effect of 5-FU-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells?,"Our results suggest that 5-FU-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells can be enhanced by the inhibitor of autophagy, 3-MA. Autophagy might play a role as a self-defense mechanism in 5-FU-treated colon cancer cells, and its inhibition could be a promising strategy for the adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer."
Does hOXB4 but not BMP4 confer self-renewal properties to ES-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells?,"Although BMP-4 promotes hematopoiesis of ES cells, its impact is only transient, whereas permanent ectopic expression of HOXB4 significantly confers self-renewal and long-term engraftment of ES-derived hematopoietic cells. This strategy could facilitate the establishment of an alternative source of hematopoietic cells that could induce transplantation tolerance."
Is phosphoinositide-phospholipase C beta1 mono-allelic deletion associated with myelodysplastic syndromes evolution into acute myeloid leukemia?,"PI-PLCbeta1 mono-allelic deletion is associated with a worse clinical outcome in MDS patients, hinting at the identification of a new group at higher risk of AML evolution and representing a reliable prognostic tool. Moreover, targeting PI-PLCbeta1 pathways might emerge as a new therapeutic strategy for MDS."

Do dystrophic neurites express C9orf72 in Alzheimer 's disease brains?,These results suggest a general role of C9orf72 in the process of neurodegeneration in a range of human neurodegenerative diseases.
Do cervical cord FMRI abnormalities differ between the progressive forms of multiple sclerosis?,"Patients with progressive MS had an over-recruitment of the cervical cord, which was more pronounced in SPMS than PPMS, despite similar cord structural damage. The alteration of the complex modulation of spinal cord interneurons possibly due to a loss of supratentorial inhibition secondary to brain injury might contribute to explain the observed functional cord abnormalities."
Does active robotic training improve locomotor function in a stroke survivor?,The results indicate that active robotic training appears to be a promising way of facilitating gait and physical function in moderately impaired stroke survivors.
Does stress-induced enhancement of mouse amygdalar synaptic plasticity depend on glucocorticoid and ß-adrenergic activity?,"Acute stress changes BLA electrical properties such that subsequent LTP induction is facilitated. Both β-adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors are involved in the development of these changes. Mineralocorticoid receptors are important for the maintenance of LTP in the BLA, irrespective of stress-induced changes in the circuit. The prolonged changes in BLA network function after stress may contribute to effective memory formation of emotional and stressful events."

The CTA spot sign accurately identifies patients destined to expand regardless of time from symptom onset, and may therefore open a path to offer clinical trials and novel therapies to the many patients who do not present acutely."
Do untrained chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii ) fail to imitate novel actions?,"Chimpanzees do not seem to copy novel actions, and only some ever copy familiar ones. Due to our having tested only non-enculturated and untrained chimpanzees, the performance of our test subjects speak more than most other studies of the general (dis-)ability of chimpanzees to copy actions, and especially novel actions."
Do eye movements reveal effects of visual content on eye guidance and lexical access during reading?,"These findings suggest that while the orchestration of multiple scales of visual content is required for normal eye-guidance during reading, a broad range of visual content can activate processes of word identification independently. Implications for understanding the role of visual content in reading are discussed."
Does gH replacement improve quality of life and metabolic parameters in cured acromegalic patients with growth hormone deficiency?,"In GHD acromegalic patients, GH therapy improved body composition, lipid profile, and quality of life as in patients with GHD due to nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, without negative effects on glucose metabolism. GH replacement therapy should be considered in these patients, as in patients with GHD from other causes."

Does next-generation sequencing of cervical DNA detect human papillomavirus types not detected by commercial kits?,"Our results indicate that there are HPV types, with substantial prevalence, in HIV positive women not being detected in molecular epidemiology studies using commercial kits. The significance of these types in relation to cervical disease remains to be investigated."
Does a common variant in the precursor miR-146a sequence predispose to cholangiocarcinoma in a large European cohort?,"Our data do not support a prominent contribution of the pre-miR-146a sequence variant in the genetic predisposition to CCA. However, current studies functionally characterizing rs2910164 have proposed that distinct repertoires of target genes are addressed by genotype-specific mature miR-146a species. Given the detected trend towards a potentially protective role of GC heterozygosity, a subtle modulation of genetic CCA risk by the pre-miR-146a GC genotype may exist and should be evaluated further."

Do blood drug concentrations of benzodiazepines correlate poorly with actual driving impairment?,"While group mean average ΔSDLP and blood drug concentration sometimes correlate, individual differences in blood drug concentrations of benzodiazepine receptor agonists correlate poorly with driving impairment. From the currently available data, it must be concluded that there are no significant relationships between individual blood drug concentration and ΔSDLP. Future driving studies should assess blood drug levels as a standard procedure, to enable further research into the relationship between blood drug concentration and performance impairment."
Are mealtime habits and meal provision associated with malnutrition among elderly patients admitted to hospital?,"The risk of malnutrition was high among elderly patients admitted to hospital, whereas the proportion with fully developed malnutrition was lower than expected. A long overnight fast, few eating episodes, and not cooking independently were associated with an increased risk of malnutrition. Knowledge of these factors when providing care to the elderly may assist health-care professionals to prevent malnutrition."
Does a review of physical activity correlate in patients with bipolar disorder?,The diversity of physical activity measures and subject samples prevented us to perform a meta-analysis.

Does precision of usual food intake estimate according to the percentage of individuals with a second dietary measurement?,"The precision of the usual intake estimates decreased when low replication rates were used. However, even with different sample sizes, replication rates >40% may not lead to an important loss of precision."
Does the Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene influence trigeminal pain-related evoked responses?,"BDNF Val66Met polymorphism affects the tPREP N2-P2 amplitude decrement and influences cortical pain processing through neurotrophin-induced neural plasticity, or through a direct BDNF neurotransmitter-like effect. Our findings suggest that upcoming BDNF central agonists might in the future play a role in pain management."
Are emotion regulation difficulties relevant to persecutory ideation?,"Besides the general difficulties in regulating emotion that are common to many clinical disorders and were associated with overall psychopathology, subclinical psychotic symptoms seem to be specifically associated with certain aspects of emotion regulation. Emotion regulation difficulties are likely to contribute to symptom formation and maintenance in persecutory delusions and might therefore present a valuable treatment target."
Does loss of Rb cooperate with Ras to drive oncogenic growth in mammalian cells?,"We have identified a new role for the Rb family in cell biogenesis and show that, as for other processes associated with tumor development, oncogenic cell growth is dependent on cooperating oncogenes."
Do many patients who undergo surgery for colorectal cancer receive surveillance colonoscopies earlier than recommended by guidelines?,Many Medicare enrollees who have undergone curative resection for colorectal cancer undergo surveillance colonoscopy more frequently than recommended by the guidelines. Reducing overuse could free limited resources for appropriate colonoscopy examinations of inadequately screened populations.
Do protein markers of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor-initiating cells reveal subpopulations in freshly isolated ovarian cancer ascites?,"In addition to demonstrating potentially high levels of TICs in ascites, the results suggest that the S-type population is the less tumorigenic one. Nanog(high)/EpCAM(high) samples represent a TIC subset which may be either M- or S-type, and which is separate from the CD44(high)/Oct-4A(high) subset observed only in M-type samples. This demonstrates a heterogeneity in TIC populations in vivo which has practical implications for TIC isolation based on cell sorting. The biological heterogeneity will need to be addressed in future therapeutical strategies."
Do resection of ictal high-frequency oscillations leads to favorable surgical outcome in pediatric epilepsy?,"Our study shows that ictal HFOs are commonly found with intracranial EEG in our population largely of children with cortical dysplasia, and have localizing value. The use of ictal HFOs may add more promising information compared to interictal HFOs because of the evidence of ictal propagation and followed by clinical aspect of seizures. Complete resection of HFOs is a favorable prognostic indicator for surgical outcome."

Is the long leg radiograph a reliable method of assessing alignment when compared to computer-assisted navigation and computer tomography?,"Given its availability and reduced radiation dose when compared to CT, LLRs should remain the mainstay of measuring the mechanical alignment of the lower limb, especially post-operatively."
Does hip flexion deformity improve without psoas-lengthening after surgical correction of fixed knee flexion deformity in spastic diplegia?,Our study demonstrates that the hip flexion deformities encountered in these patients will improve spontaneously when the distal fixed knee flexion deformity is surgically corrected. Therefore correction at the knee allows the ground reaction force to assume a more normal position resulting in correction at the hip over time. This then removes the need for surgery at the hip level. This fact is especially important when applied to psoas lengthening as this procedure can cause significant reduction in propulsion power.
Is selective neck dissection effective in N1/N2 nodal stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma?,"SND may produce a satisfactory ipsilateral regional control rate in patients with early-stage node-positive oral squamous cell carcinoma. A prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing SND with modified radical neck dissection may be required for a categorical conclusion of these findings."
Does magnetoencephalographic imaging of resting-state functional connectivity predict postsurgical neurological outcome in brain gliomas?,Magnetoencephalography connectivity analysis gives a valuable preoperative evaluation of the functionality of the tissue surrounding tumors in perieloquent and eloquent areas. These data may be used to optimize preoperative patient counseling and surgical strategy.

Is atrial fibrillation associated with severe sleep-disordered breathing in patients with ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack?,"Most Japanese patients with acute ischaemic stroke and TIA had SDB, and AF was associated with SDB."
"Is altered brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in the ventral tegmental area , but not in the hippocampus , essential for antidepressant-like effects of electroconvulsive therapy?","While neuroplastic alterations, as expressed by changes in BDNF expression within different brain regions, are induced by ECT, the antidepressant-like effect of ECT in an animal model depends on reduction of VTA BDNF expression but not on the elevation of hippocampal BDNF expression."
Does chronic social instability induce anxiety and defective social interactions across generations?,"These findings support the idea that individual risk for psychiatric disorders that involve enhanced anxiety and/or social dysfunction may be dependent not only on the specific alleles of genes that are inherited from one's parents and on one's own experiences, but also on the experiences of one's parents when they were young."
Does preschoolers ' delay of gratification predict their body mass 30 years later?,"Longer delay of gratification at age 4 years was associated with a lower BMI 3 decades later. Because this study is correlational, it is not possible to make causal inferences regarding the relationship between delay duration and BMI. Identifying children with greater difficulty in delaying gratification could help detect children at risk of becoming overweight or obese. Interventions that improve self-control in young children have been developed and might reduce children's risk of becoming overweight and also have positive effects on other outcomes important to society."
Does gene expression profiling reveal the defining features of monocytes from septic patients with compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome?,"Monocytes from CARS patients exhibited significant changes in mRNA expression of genes associated with phagocytosis, antigen presentation, inflammatory response, cell migration, and apoptosis, which might cause deactivation of monocytes during CARS."
Do the correlation between human papillomavirus positivity and abnormal cervical cytology result differs by age among perimenopausal women?,"Although the relative proportion of low-grade and high-grade abnormalities did not change with age, we saw a loss of concordance between HR-HPV detection and cytological abnormalities with increasing age. Current guidelines for cervical cancer screening group together all women age 30 years and older. Our data raise important questions about the interpretation of HPV and Pap test results in this age group and suggest that ongoing surveillance of HPV and cytology in cervical cancer screening programs consider a third age stratification among older women."
Do kidneys from older living donors provide excellent intermediate-term outcomes after transplantation?,"Older living donor kidneys can be transplanted with low perioperative risk without compromising recipient 5-year patient or graft survival or donor renal function. Younger donor kidneys have superior graft function 5 years after transplantation, highlighting the need for appropriate donor/recipient matching."
Does fish oil supplementation augment post-exercise immune function in young males?,The current study demonstrates that fish oil supplementation reduces increases PBMC IL-2 production and NK cell cytotoxic activity in the recovery period after exercise.

Is basal Ki67 expression measured by digital image analysis optimal for prognostication in oral squamous cell carcinoma?,Our study provides a framework for reaching a consensus on the optimal approach for measuring Ki67 expression in cancers. Our results suggest that rigorous comparisons of measurement approaches should be applied in a tumour-type and treatment-specific manner to enhance the clinical application of Ki67 assessment.
"Is ghWRKY15 , a member of the WRKY transcription factor family identified from cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L. ) , involved in disease resistance and plant development?","Overall, our data suggest that overexpression of GhWRKY15 may contribute to the alteration of defence resistance to both viral and fungal infections, probably through regulating the ROS system via multiple signalling pathways in tobacco. It is intriguing that GhWRKY15 overexpression in tobacco affects plant growth and development, especially stem elongation. This finding suggests that the role of the WRKY proteins in disease resistance may be closely related to their function in regulating plant growth and development."
Does high expression of ADAM8 correlate with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma?,"These findings provide evidence that a high expression level of ADAM8 serves as a biomarker for poor prognosis for HCC. Thus, we speculate that ADAM8 may be a potential target of antiangiogenic therapy for HCC."
Is a strategy to reduce illicit drug use effective in elite Australian football?,An illicit drugs programme using a harm minimisation strategy can work effectively alongside a sport's WADA compliant Anti-Doping Code.
Does local ASIC3 modulate pain and disease progression in a rat model of osteoarthritis?,"Local ASIC3 immunoreactive nerve is strongly associated with weight-bearing pain and secondary hyperalgesia in MIA-induced OA model. APETx2 inhibited ASIC3 upregulation in knee joint afferents regardless of the time-point of administration. Furthermore, early administration of APETx2 prevented cartilage damage. APETx2 is a novel, promising drug for OA by relieving pain and inhibiting disease progression."

Overall, this study provides a deeper molecular understanding of the heterogeneity existing within the breast tumor vasculature and opens new avenues toward the improved design and targeting of antiangiogenic therapies."
Is community-based Argentine tango dance program associated with increased activity participation among individuals with Parkinson 's disease?,"Individuals with PD who participated in a community-based Argentine tango class reported increased participation in complex daily activities, recovery of activities lost since the onset of PD, and engagement in new activities. Incorporating dance into the clinical management of PD may benefit participation and subsequently quality of life for this population."
Is endoscopic resection of upper neck masses via retroauricular approach feasible with excellent cosmetic outcomes?,"Endoscopic resection using the retroauricular approach is feasible for various benign upper neck masses when conducted by an experienced endoscopic surgeon, with excellent cosmetic results."
Do the PRRT2 mutation c.649dupC is the so far most frequent cause of benign familial infantile convulsions?,Our data demonstrate that the PRRT2 mutation c.649dupC is a frequent cause of benign familial infantile convulsions.
Does jAK inhibition with tofacitinib suppress arthritic joint structural damage through decreased RANKL production?,"These results suggest that the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib suppresses osteoclast-mediated structural damage to arthritic joints, and this effect is secondary to decreased RANKL production."
Do aneurysms increase the risk of rebleeding after stereotactic radiosurgery for hemorrhagic arteriovenous malformations?,"When an aneurysm is identified in patients with arteriovenous malformations selected for SRS, additional endovascular or surgical strategies should be considered to reduce the risk of bleeding during the latency interval."
Are genetic variants associated with myocardial infarction in the PSMA6 gene and Chr9p21 also associated with ischaemic stroke?,"Our results provide evidence that chromosome 9p21 variants are associated with cardioembolic ischaemic stroke in Caucasians and with overall ischaemic stroke in African Americans. The PSMA6 variant rs1048990 also appears to affect susceptibility to ischaemic stroke in both populations. These findings require validation, particularly the preliminary findings regarding African Americans given the small size of that series."
Does degradation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans enhance oxidized-LDL-mediated autophagy and apoptosis in human endothelial cells?,These data demonstrate that Hep III enhances the pro-atherosclerotic characteristics in HUVECs induced by ox-LDL.
Is a model for the relative biological effectiveness of protons : the tissue specific parameter α/β of photons a predictor for the sensitivity to LET changes?,"A statistically significant relation was found between α for protons and LET. Moreover, the strength of that relation varied significantly with (α/β)phot. In contrast, no significant relation between β and LET was found. On the whole, the resulting RBE model provided a significantly improved fit (p-value < 0.01) to the experimental data compared to the standard constant RBE. By accounting for the α/β ratio of photons, clearer trends between RBE and LET of protons were found, and our results suggest that late responding tissues are more sensitive to LET changes than early responding tissues and most tumors. An advantage with the proposed RBE model in optimization and evaluation of treatment plans is that it only requires dose, LET, and (α/β)phot as input parameters. Hence, no proton specific biological parameters are needed."
Does [ IL-10 suppress inflammatory granuloma uptake of 18F-FDG in rats ]?,IL-10 can suppress the inflammatory granuloma of SD rats uptaking 18F-FDG.
Does pro-inflammatory interleukin-18 increase Alzheimer 's disease-associated amyloid-β production in human neuron-like cells?,"The IL-18 induction of BACE-1, APP processing, and Aβ is likely to be linked to stress-associated adaptations in neurons during the course of normal functioning and development. However, in the course of wider changes in the aging brain, and particularly in AD, the effects of heightened or prolonged levels of IL-18 may contribute to the process of AD, including via increased Aβ."
Is milk oral immunotherapy effective in school-aged children?,"  This placebo-controlled, double-blind study confirmed that OIT was effective in desensitizing schoolchildren with CMA. With occasional exceptions, the reached desensitization sustained for more than 3 years."
Is malignant calcification an important unfavorable prognostic factor in primary invasive breast cancer?,"Mammographic calcification is a poor prognostic factor for patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. Its prognostic value is second only to axillary node status and greater than the other factors evaluated. Thus, breast cancers with calcifications should be regarded as high risk when determining adjuvant treatment."
Does gluten-free diet appear to induce endoscopic remission of eosinophilic esophagitis in children with coexistent celiac disease?,"The prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis in patients with celiac disease was 4.4%, confirming a higher than expected prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis compared with the general population. In patients with celiac disease, a gluten-free diet did not appear to induce remission of coexistent endoscopic and histological features of eosinophilic esophagitis."
Does structural imbalance promote behavior analogous to aesthetic preference in domestic chicks?,"Our results are consistent with the idea that the coding of structural imbalance is primary and even overrides classical conditioning. Generalized to the humans, these results suggest aesthetic judgments based upon structural imbalance may be based on evolutionarily ancient mechanisms, which are shared by different vertebrate species."
Is increased body mass index associated with a global and distributed decrease in white matter microstructural integrity?,"Our results show that increased BMI is globally associated with a reduction in white matter integrity throughout the brain, elucidating a potential mechanism by which changes in physical health may influence cognitive health."
Is maternal early-pregnancy vitamin D status associated with maternal depressive symptoms in the Amsterdam Born Children and Their Development cohort?,"In this study, low early-pregnancy vitamin D status was associated with elevated depressive symptoms in pregnancy.

Does haploinsufficiency of Cyfip1 produce fragile X-like phenotypes in mice?,These results demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of Cyfip1 mimics key aspects of the phenotype of Fmr1 knockout mice and are consistent with the hypothesis that these effects are mediated by interaction of Cyfip1 and Fmrp in regulating activity-dependent translation. The data provide support for a model where CYFIP1 haploinsufficiency in patients results in intermediate phenotypes increasing risk for neuropsychiatric disorders.
Are elevated interleukin-6 concentration and alterations of the coagulation system associated with the development of intraventricular hemorrhage in extremely preterm infants?,The association of elevated IL-6 levels with alterations of the coagulation profile and development of IVH found in our study supports the assumption of a close pathophysiological relation between inflammation and IVH.
Does src Inhibition with saracatinib reverse fulvestrant resistance in ER-positive ovarian cancer models in vitro and in vivo?,"Saracatinib augments effects of fulvestrant by opposing estrogen-mediated Src activation and target gene expression, increasing cell-cycle arrest, and impairing survival, all of which would oppose antiestrogen resistance in these ER+ ovarian cancer models. These data support further preclinical and clinical evaluation of combined fulvestrant and saracatinib in ovarian cancer."
Is loss of DBC2 expression an early and progressive event in the development of lung adenocarcinoma?,We conclude that loss of DBC2 expression is an early and progressive event in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma.

Is risk assessment at the end of pregnancy a poor predictor for complications at delivery?,"Individual prediction of obstetric emergencies has low accuracy, which should be included in the information to women as well as in discussions with health pianners."
Does flow cytometric analysis of gut mucosal lymphocytes support an impaired Th1 cytokine profile in spondyloarthropathy?,An impaired Th1 cytokine profile is observed in gut mucosal lymphocytes from patients with SpA. This adds to the existing evidence that the gut mucosal immune apparatus is involved in the pathogenesis of SpA.
Is the high prevalence of autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase in first-degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes associated with islet autoimmunity?,"We found a high prevalence of celiac autoimmunity in patients and first-degree relatives of children with type 1 diabetes, but we found limited overlap between islet and celiac autoimmunity in nondiabetic relatives. The high prevalence of celiac autoimmunity may be explained by shared genetic susceptibility and identifies a population within which screening for the disease may be justified."
"Is exclusive breast-feeding rarely practised in rural and urban Morogoro , Tanzania?","The better performance of urban mothers could be partly due to sustained breast-feeding support in hospital settings and other campaigns which may not have reached the rural areas. In both the rural and urban areas more efforts are needed to encourage exclusive breast-feeding, to avoid premature complementation and, in the case of the urban areas, to protect extended breast-feeding."
Is total and specific IgE in nasal polyps related to local eosinophilic inflammation?,"These studies suggest that there is an association between increased levels of total IgE, specific IgE, and eosinophilic inflammation in NPs, which may be of relevance in the pathophysiology of nasal polyposis. Similarly, the presence of specific IgE to staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B also points to a possible role of bacterial superantigens."
Do combined pre- and post-surgical bupivacaine wound infiltrations decrease opioid requirements after knee ligament reconstruction?,We conclude that a combination of selective pre- and post-surgical wound infiltration with bupivacaine 0.25% provides superior analgesia compared with a standard post-surgical intra-articular injection alone.
Do sentinel lymph node micrometastasis and other histologic factors that predict outcome in patients with thicker melanomas?,"The results indicate that the SLN node status is predictive of disease-free survival for patients with thick melanomas. A surprising number of patients in the study were free of disease after prolonged follow-up. None of the histologic features of the primary tumor were helpful in predicting outcome, except for ulceration. SLN biopsy appears to be justified for prognostic purposes in patients with thick melanomas."
Does paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy cause encephalopathy in patients with ovarian cancer : a prospective EEG mapping study in 28 patients?,The results of this study suggest that chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel and carboplatin does not cause adverse effects on the central nervous system. Improved vigilance was measured in patients with ovarian cancer after chemotherapy.
Do evaluation of a balanced fresh paste diet for maintenance of captive neotropical rattlesnakes used for venom production?,Results suggest that a balanced fresh paste diet has sufficient nutritional value to avoid weight loss and death and does not adversely affect venom quality in captive neotropical rattlesnakes.
Does vitamin B ( 6 ) therapy improve hematocrit in hemodialysis patients supplemented with iron and erythropoietin?,"The results indicate that in hemodialysis patients with normal pyridoxine status who, despite appropriate supplementation of iron and EPO, fail to reach optimal hematocrit levels, additional pyridoxine treatment does not produce any hematocrit elevation."
Does helicobacter pylori infection reduce systemic availability of dietary vitamin C?,"H. pylori substantially impairs the bio-availability of vitamin C. This, together with the reduced vitamin C intake of H. pylori-positive subjects, markedly reduces the plasma vitamin C level of infected subjects. The reduced circulating levels of vitamin C in H. pylori-infected subjects may contribute to the aetiology of gastric cancer, as well as other diseases associated with anti-oxidant deficiency."
Is gut luminal neutrophil migration influenced by the anatomical site of Crohn 's disease?,Neutrophil migration to the gut lumen in Crohn's disease is a feature of colonic disease irrespective of associated ileal lesions. This suggests that bacterial-derived chemo-attractants may play a role. High levels of IL-8 in colonic disease are consistent with this hypothesis.
Do changes in genioglossus muscle activity in obstructive sleep apnea patients with and without snore guard?,The effect of Snore Guard on OSA patients is a mechanical enlargement of upper airway volume. The genioglossus muscle is passive during treatment.
Are serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels correlated with body mass index rather than route of administration in women undergoing in vitro fertilization -- embryo transfer using human menopausal gonadotropin and intracytoplasmic sperm injection?,"The highest levels of hCG were measured in women with the lowest BMI. Patients' body size, rather than route of hCG delivery, appears to determine circulating levels of hCG."
Does 830-nm irradiation increase the wound tensile strength in a diabetic murine model?,Low-power laser irradiation at 830 nm significantly enhances cutaneous wound tensile strength in a murine diabetic model. Further investigation of the mechanism of LLLT in primary wound healing is warranted.
Does piracetam therapy enhance cognitive functioning in children with down syndrome?,Piracetam therapy did not enhance cognition or behavior but was associated with adverse effects.
Is the distribution of major lymphocyte subsets in cord blood associated with its pH?,Cord blood pH and labor-associated variables should be taken into account to adequately interpret the profile of major lymphocyte subsets as a marker of the effect of different prenatal factors on the immune system of neonates.
Does spinal radiation before surgical decompression adversely affect outcomes of surgery for symptomatic metastatic spinal cord compression?,"Spinal radiation before surgical decompression for metastatic spinal cord compression is associated with a significantly higher major wound complication rate. In addition, preoperative spinal irradiation might adversely affect the surgical outcome."
Is variation in clinical decision making a partial explanation for geographical variation in lower extremity amputation rates?,Variations in the clinical decisions made by vascular surgeons given the same patient are likely to explain at least a part of the observed geographical variation in rates of lower extremity amputation. Consensus guidelines may enable more consistent decision making for this problem.
Do igE mimotopes of birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 induce blocking IgG in mice?,Allergen mimotopes can be used for the induction of anti allergen IgG of desired specificity. We propose that mimotope immunotherapy based on IgE mimotopes generated by biopannings may represent a future concept for therapy of type I allergy.
Is intravenous ketamine plus midazolam superior to intranasal midazolam for emergency paediatric procedural sedation?,Intravenous ketamine plus midazolam used in an appropriate setting by experienced personnel provides an excellent means of achieving sedation suitable for most non-painful minor procedures for children in the emergency department. This combination is superior to INM in terms of speed of onset and consistency of effect. INM delivered via aerosol spray has a more variable effect but may still be adequate for the completion of many of these procedures.
Does `` Puffed-cheek '' CT improve evaluation of the oral cavity?,"The puffed-cheek CT maneuver is easily taught, and patients comply readily. Puffed-cheek CT scans provide a clearer and more detailed evaluation of mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity than do conventional scans. In selected patients, the puffed-cheek technique can supplement conventional CT studies."
Is fluctuation in autonomic tone a major determinant of sustained atrial arrhythmias in patients with focal ectopy originating from the pulmonary veins?,"In patients with focal ectopy originating from the pulmonary veins, sustained episodes of atrial arrhythmias are mainly dependent on variations of autonomic tone, with a significant shift toward vagal predominance before AF onset."
Does a new mutation in a family with cold-aggravated myotonia disrupt Na ( + ) channel inactivation?,This novel mutation of the sodium channel indicates that a single carbon change in a transmembrane alpha-helix of domain I can alter channel inactivation and cause cold-sensitive myotonia.
Is secondary calpain3 deficiency in 2q-linked muscular dystrophy : titin the candidate gene?,"These results imply that titin mutations may be responsible for TMD, and that the pathophysiologic pathway following calpain3 deficiency may overlap with LGMD2A. The loss of calpain3 could be a downstream effect of the deficient TMD gene product. The significance of the secondary calpain3 defect for the pathogenesis of TMD was emphasized by similar calpain3 deficiency in the MDM mouse, which is suggested to be a mouse model for TMD. Homozygous mutation at the 2q locus may thus be capable of producing yet another LGMD."
Does sequential map-guided endocardial resection for ventricular tachycardia improve outcome?,"Sequential map-guided endocardial resection at normothermia was associated with low operative mortality and low postoperative inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia. The selected therapeutic approach resulted in freedom of arrhythmia recurrence and cardiac mortality including sudden death, during long-term follow-up."
Is expression of proinflammatory and Th1 but not Th2 cytokines enhanced in gastric mucosa of Helicobacter pylori infected children?,"The findings of this study indicate that, in children, Helicobacter pylori-induced inflammatory response would favour production of proinflammatory cytokines and development of cell-mediated immunity, namely Th1 response."
Are psychosocial variables associated with atherosclerosis risk factors among women with chest pain : the WISE study?,These results demonstrate consistent and clinically relevant relationships between psychosocial factors and atherosclerosis risk factors among women and may aid our understanding of the increased mortality risk among women reporting high levels of psychological distress.
Do cortisol-secreting adrenal adenomas express 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-2 gene yet possess low 11beta-HSD2 activity?,"Collectively, our findings indicate that cortisol-secreting adrenal adenomas express the 11beta-HSD2 gene, but the activity of the enzyme is suppressed in adenomas when compared with the normal adrenal cortex. We advance the hypothesis that the elevated local concentration of steroid hormones that occur in adenomas down-regulates 11beta-HSD2 activity, thereby contributing to their abnormal steroidogenic function."
Does adiposity in childhood predict obesity and insulin resistance in young adulthood?,"These data confirm that adiposity in childhood is a strong predictor of young adult adiposity. In addition, these results demonstrate that cardiovascular risk in young adulthood is highly related to the degree of adiposity as early as age 13."
Does transdermal estrogen reduce vascular resistance and serum cholesterol in postmenopausal women?,"Equivalent reductions in vascular resistance index, norepinephrine, mean arterial pressure, and cholesterol were observed with transdermal and oral estrogens. Future studies comparing novel hormone regimens with oral hormone replacement therapy should include multiple risk markers to allow better assessment of their potential impact on coronary artery health."
Does screen-based anesthesia simulation with debriefing improve performance in a mannequin-based anesthesia simulator?,Residents who managed anesthetic problems using a screen-based anesthesia simulator handled the emergencies in a mannequin-based anesthesia simulator better than residents who were asked to study a handout covering the same problems. Computer simulations with feedback are effective as a supplement to traditional residency training methods for the management of medical emergencies.
Does bladder opacification significantly influence dose distribution in conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer?,"Bladder opacification used during simulation does not significantly influence prostate or rectal dose distributions in prostate patients treated with 3D-CRT, 18 MV X-rays, and a six-beam arrangement."
Do partially wedged beams improve radiotherapy treatment of urinary bladder cancer?,PWBs represent a simple dose conformation tool that may allow radiation dose escalation in the treatment of muscle-infiltrating urinary bladder tumours.

Both valves offer favorable hemodynamic performance and functional improvement."
Is histocompatibility leukocyte antigen-G expressed by endometriosis or endometrial tissue?,Immune cell inhibition in endometriosis must be mediated by factors other than HLA-G.
Does cardiopulmonary bypass elicit a pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine response and impaired neutrophil chemotaxis in neonatal pigs?,"The CPB procedure elicited a systemic inflammatory response in terms of significantly elevated plasma levels of IL-8 and IL-10. Furthermore, a temporary and simultaneous decrease in PMN chemotaxis was observed immediately after CPB."
Do endocervical Gram stain smears and their usefulness in the diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis?,The use of endocervical Gram smear results together with clinical information can be used to identify high risk women for C trachomatis infection.
Is duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis related inversely to presenting disease stage in children with medulloblastoma?,"Contrary to expectations, the duration of presenting symptoms was correlated inversely with disease state at the time of presentation. This finding has implications for lawsuits alleging that a ""delay in diagnosis"" leads to more advanced disease. There is weak evidence (P = 0.08) that males have a longer duration of symptoms than females. This may be related to gender-associated behavior expectations."
Do serum levels of interleukin 6 and stress related substances indicate mental stress condition in patients with rheumatoid arthritis?,"In patients with RA, excessive mental stress should be eliminated to modify the interaction between the stress-immune system and stress-endocrine system as a method to better control disease activity."
Does analysis of false-positive BTA STAT test result in patients followed up for bladder cancer?,"Patients with a positive BTA stat Test result but negative cystoscopic findings have about a 16% risk of an undetected recurrence. False-positive results may be due to present instillation treatment and urine infection, and the predictive value of a BTA stat Test for subsequent recurrence seems relatively low."
Is phospholipase C activity of Helicobacter pylori associated with the presence of the cagA gene?,"Although PLC activity was present in all strains tested, it may only have pathological importance in patients with GU. However, the extent of PLC activity was independent of the presence of the cagA gene."
Is heavy drinking associated with more severe psychosocial dysfunction among girls than boys in Finland?,Heavy drinking is associated with more severe psychosocial dysfunction among girls than boys. It may be possible to identify girls at school who drink heavily and guide them toward treatment.
Are nicotine-induced enhancements in the five-choice serial reaction time task in rats strain-dependent?,"The magnitude of improvement in accuracy seen with nicotine in SD rats is greater than previously demonstrated using lesion or parametric manipulation models in other strains of rat in this test of attention. Although this suggests that the SD strain may be a useful ""tool"" for future studies, other task parameters, such as stimulus duration, may have to be optimum to demonstrate the magnitude of improvement observed presently."
Does earlier diagnosis of second primary melanoma confirm the benefits of patient education and routine postoperative follow-up?,"In this study, the second primary melanoma in patients with a prior cutaneous melanoma was significantly thinner than the initial primary lesion. This is evidence that careful follow-up and patient education allow earlier diagnosis. All patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma should be counseled regarding the risks of second melanoma and should undergo lifelong follow-up at biannual intervals."
Do a pessimistic attitude towards the future and low psychosocial functioning predict psychiatric diagnosis among treatment-seeking adolescents?,Health service staff should be aware of factors associated with psychiatric disorders in adolescents so that they can identify those at high risk.
Do psychiatric disorders affect outcomes of antireflux operations for gastroesophageal reflux disease?,"Patients with psychiatric disorders are rarely satisfied with the results of antireflux surgery. Moreover, these patients demonstrated less symptomatic relief than patients without psychiatric disorders. Patients who were dissatisfied with antireflux surgery--even those without psychiatric disorders--had lower scores on the SF-36 mental health domain. These results suggest that even patients who might otherwise be candidates for antireflux surgery may have a poor symptomatic outcome, if they also have low mental health domain scores. Antireflux surgery in patients who suffer from major depression or anxiety disorder should be approached with great trepidation."
Are early puberty and early sexual activity associated with bulimic-type eating pathology in middle adolescence?,"To prevent bulimia nervosa and to create opportunities for early intervention, attention should be paid to early maturing girls and off-time maturing boys, as well as those with early onset of sexual activity."
Are factors associated with medicine use and self medication different in adolescents?,"The data from this study demonstrate a high prevalence of medicine use and self medication; however, the variables associated with medicine use and self medication differed. Urgent strategies to promote the rational use of drugs in this population and their families are necessary."
Does proteomic analysis of intra-arterial thrombus secretions reveal a negative association of clusterin and thrombospondin-1 with abdominal aortic aneurysm?,This proteomic analysis has identified a group of proteins concentrated in AAA ILT. Assessment of circulating concentrations of two representative polypeptides suggests for the first time that the ILT selectively sequesters proteins rather than actively releasing them. Further work is required to assess the mechanisms underpinning this observation and the associated clinical implications.
Is auditory novelty processing enhanced in obsessive-compulsive disorder?,It is suggested that the novelty P3 amplitude increase in OCD patients represents a physiological indicator of an enhanced cortical orienting response implicating stronger involuntary shifts of attention. This characteristic is driven by novelty per se and not moderated by potential threat of upcoming events.
Does transcapsular arterial neovascularization after liver transplantation in pediatric patients indicate transplant failure?,"Transcapsular arterial neovascularization, detected with color Doppler US, occurred in 9.5% (13 of 137) of pediatric patients and 8.4% (13 of 155) of liver transplants and was associated with underlying malperfusion and inflammation. The diagnosis of transcapsular arterial neovascularization was associated with reduced graft survival times and a high retransplantation rate. The negative prognostic value of the sign may assist in a strategy of organ allocation."
Does treatment of metabolic syndrome slow progression of diabetic nephropathy?,Metabolic syndrome treatment and control are independently associated with a lesser progression of DN.

Does the association between anomalous self-experience and suicidality in first-episode schizophrenia seem mediated by depression?,The interaction between anomalous self-experiences and depression could be a rational clinical target for the prevention of suicidality in the early phases of schizophrenia and supports the rationale for including assessment of SDs in early intervention efforts.
Does t-cell compartment in synovial fluid of pediatric patients with JIA correlate with disease phenotype?,"In pediatric JIA patients, we showed an alteration in the T cells from synovial fluid, which correlated with disease phenotype, assumedly secondary to enhanced proliferation, clonal TCR restriction, and reduced T-cell production, possibly reflecting a different disease or a different course of disease progression."
Are comparison of eight diagnostic algorithms for liver fibrosis in hepatitis C : new algorithms more precise and entirely noninvasive?,"SAFE and BA for significant fibrosis or cirrhosis are very accurate. However, their successive use induces a significant decrease in diagnostic accuracy and a significant increase in required liver biopsy. A new fibrosis classification that synchronously combines two fibrosis tests was as accurate as successive SAFE or BA, while providing an entirely noninvasive (0% liver biopsy) and more precise (six versus two or three fibrosis classes) fibrosis diagnosis."
Does detection of asymptomatic adenocarcinoma at endoscopy prior to gastric banding justify routine endoscopy?,"The detection of two early, asymptomatic oesophageal adenocarcinomas in a high risk patient group justifies our policy of routine upper GI endoscopy prior to gastric banding surgery."
Does a novel reporter of notch signalling indicate regulated and random Notch activation during vertebrate neurogenesis?,"A novel Notch reporter with multiple destabilisation elements provides a faithful read-out of endogenous Notch activity on a cell-by-cell basis, as neural progenitors progress through the cell cycle in the chick neural tube. Notch activity patterns in this cell population provide evidence for distinct Notch signalling dynamics underlying different cell division modes and for the involvement of random initiation of Notch signalling within the neuroepithelium. These findings highlight the importance of single-cell analysis in the study of the complexity of Notch activity and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying cell fate decisions in neural progenitors."
Is the shortest way to reach nutritional goals to adopt Mediterranean food choices : evidence from computer-generated personalized diets?,"Whether recommendations on total fats, MUFAs, or total carbohydrates are included or not in the definition of overall nutrient adequacy, foods typical of the Mediterranean diet are needed to reach overall nutrient adequacy."
Does one-year choroidal thickness result after photodynamic therapy for central serous chorioretinopathy?,"Half-dose photodynamic therapy for central serous chorioretinopathy resulted in thinner subfoveal choroidal thickness 1 month after treatment, decreased the choroidal vascular hyperpermeability, and maintained the remission for 1 year. Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography was helpful for monitoring the pathophysiologic choroidal changes in central serous chorioretinopathy."
Are plasma concentrations of efavirenz associated with body weight in HIV-positive individuals?,"In this cohort of well-controlled HIV-positive individuals, patients with lower weight or body mass index had a higher chance of presenting elevated plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Therapeutic drug monitoring to adjust dose might be a helpful tool to decrease efavirenz dose in order to minimize costs and adverse effects."
Does microRNA-758 regulate cholesterol efflux through posttranscriptional repression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1?,"We identified miR-758 as a novel miRNA that posttranscriptionally controls ABCA1 levels in different cells and regulates macrophage cellular cholesterol efflux to apoA1, opening new avenues to increase apoA1 and raise high-density lipoprotein levels."
Do anatomy and physiology predict response to motor cortex stimulation after stroke?,"In this clinical stroke trial, the more that the physiologic integrity of the motor system was preserved, the more likely that a patient was to derive gains from subsequent therapy, consistent with preclinical models. Functional and structural preservation of key brain substrates are important to deriving gain from a restorative therapy."
Are qRS duration and QTc interval predictors of risk for ventricular arrhythmias during cardiac resynchronization therapy?,A pacing-induced increase in QTc and QRSd is related to sVTA in patients with CRT. Further studies are needed to determine whether optimization of CRT with the goal to achieve a narrow paced QRSd can reduce the occurrence of sVTA.
Does hypoglycemia impair quality of blood glucose simulation in a clinical decision support system?,"The present data show that hypoglycemia introduces substantial and systematic simulation errors for up to 24 h after hypoglycemia. This underlines the need for further evaluation of mechanisms behind this putative long-term glucose counter-regulation to hypoglycemia. When using blood glucose simulations in decision support systems, the results indicate that simulations for several hours following a hypoglycemic event may underestimate glucose levels by 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/liter) or more."
Is glucocorticoid receptor polymorphism associated with lithium response in bipolar patients?,The GR gene variation seems to be involved in the response to lithium treatment in our group of bipolar patients.
Does abnormal T2-weighted MRI signal surrounding lead in a subset of deep brain stimulation patients?,"Fifteen instances of T2 signal hyperintensity surrounding DBS leads on postoperative MRI scans were observed across 239 implants (6.3% incidence) in 133 patients. The signal characteristics were most consistent with vasogenic edema, possibly representing an inflammatory response. The finding was typically unilateral, even in patients with simultaneous bilateral lead implants. Most affected patients were asymptomatic, although 3 were symptomatic and 1 experienced marked gait instability that was treated with steroids. T2 signal abnormality was seen more commonly in scans obtained 3 or more days after surgery than in those collected immediately postoperatively. No differences in age, anatomical target, diagnosis, or number of microelectrode passes were noted between patients with or without T2 signal. Further research will be needed to explain this curious neuroimaging finding, and to rule out cause for clinical concern."
Is liver stiffness measured by transient elastography a predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma development in viral hepatitis?,  Liver stiffness as measured by transient elastography is a predictor of HCC development in viral hepatitis.
Does acute inhalation of hypertonic saline improve mucociliary clearance in all children with cystic fibrosis?,"These data suggest that percent MCC varies significantly between children with CF lung disease and normal pulmonary functions, with some children demonstrating MCC values within the normal range and others showing MCC values that are below normal values. In addition, although MCC did not improve in all children after inhalation of HS, improvement did occur in children with relatively low MCC values after placebo. This finding suggests that acute inhalation of hypertonic saline may benefit a subset of children with low MCC values."
Does a unique protein profile of peripheral neutrophils from COPD patients reflect cytokine-induced protein profiles of neutrophils in vitro?,"These results show that neutrophils from COPD patients have a unique protein profile compared to neutrophils from healthy age-matched controls. Furthermore, the neutrophil profiles of COPD patients do not reflect putative dominant signals induced by TNFα, GM-CSF or their combination. Our results indicate that systemic neutrophil responses in COPD patients are caused by a unique but subtle interplay between multiple inflammatory signals."
Does patterns and correlate of prescription opioid use in OEF/OIF veterans with chronic noncancer pain?,Prescription opioid use is common among OEF/OIF veterans with CNCP and is associated with several pain diagnoses and medical conditions.
"Is mindfulness associated with fewer PTSD symptoms , depressive symptoms , physical symptoms , and alcohol problems in urban firefighters?","Mindfulness may be important to consider and include in models of stress, coping, and resilience in firefighters. Future studies should examine the prospective relationship between mindfulness and health in firefighters and others in high-stress occupations."
Do multivariate graphical methods provide an insightful way to formulate explanatory hypotheses from limited categorical data?,"Illustrative applications of a sequence of graphical procedures yield more informative and less abstract representations of limited data than do descriptive statistics alone, and by doing so, they aid in the formulation of explanatory hypotheses."
Does medical journal cover -- an analysis of gendered images and how these might influence best practice?,"While the images investigated are engaging and sometimes amusing, we explore meanings beyond our engagement as a viewer. The discussion focuses on the need for promotion of best practice, in words and pictures, to model best professional practice."

Are aortic stiffness and vitamin D independent markers of aortic calcification in patients with peripheral arterial disease and in healthy subjects?,These results indicate that calcification of the aorta is independently associated with aortic stiffness and serum 25(OH)D level in patients with PAD and in healthy subjects. Aortic stiffness and abnormal vitamin D level may contribute to vascular calcification and are related to higher severity grade of atherosclerotic disease.
Do fatigue resistance of 2 different CAD/CAM glass-ceramic materials used for single-tooth implant crowns?,"Lack in chemical adhesion between titanium abutment and dental cement likely reduces the fatigue resistance of machinable glass-ceramic materials. However, relatively better fractural strength of leucite glass-ceramics could be taken into consideration. Accordingly, progress on developmental changes in filler composition of glass-ceramics may be promising."
Are platelet antibodies and fetal growth : maternal antibodies against fetal platelet antigen 1a strongly associated with reduced birthweight in boys?,A linear relation between maternal anti-HPA 1a antibody levels and reduced birthweight in boys was demonstrated. Reduced birthweight should be considered a possible complication of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia.
Is the maximum standardized uptake value ( SUVmax ) on FDG-PET a strong predictor of local recurrence for localized non-small-cell lung cancer after stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT )?,"SUVmax was the strongest predictor for local recurrence. A high SUVmax may be considered for dose escalation to improve local control. Additional follow-up is needed to determine if SUVmax is correlated with regional recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival."
Do microenvironmental genomic alterations reveal signaling networks for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma?,"We verified the involvement of T-cell receptor signaling pathways in HNSCC as well as associated oncogenes such as LCK and PLCB1, and tumor suppressors such as STAT5A, PTPN6, PARK2. We identified expression levels of genes within significant LOH/AI regions specific to stroma networks that correlate with better outcome in radiation therapy. By integrating various levels of high-throughput data, we were able to precisely focus on specific proteins and genes that are germane to HNSCC."
Does viscoelastic clot strength predict coagulation-related mortality within 15 minutes?,"These data suggest that the point-of-care TEG parameter clot strength (G) provides consistent, independent prediction of MT and MT-death early in the resuscitation of injured patients."
Does telestroke-guided intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment achieve a similar clinical outcome as thrombolysis at a comprehensive stroke center?,Telestroke is a viable alternative to in-person evaluation when stroke expertise is not readily available.
Does concentration of hyaluronic acid in human vocal fold in young and old subjects?,"HA concentrations are higher in the cover and ligament compared with the muscle in both genders and age groups, and there is a higher HA concentration in ligament compared with the muscle of young subjects of both genders. HA levels in the cover samples of younger women showed great variability that may relate to ovarian hormone levels, reflecting different phases of the menstrual cycle."

Do major depression and treatment response in adolescents with ADHD and substance use disorder?,"These preliminary findings suggest that compared to non-depressed adolescents with ADHD and SUD, those with co-occurring MDD have more severe substance use at baseline and throughout treatment. Such youth may require interventions targeting depression."
"Is in vitro toxicity of particulate matter ( PM ) collected at different sites in the Netherlands associated with PM composition , size fraction and oxidative potential -- the RAPTES project?",The response of RAW264.7 cells to ambient PM was markedly different using samples collected at various sites in the Netherlands that differed in their local PM emission sources. Our results are in support of other investigations showing that the chemical composition as well as oxidative potential are determinants of PM induced toxicity in vitro.
Is plasma dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate related to personality and stress response?,DHEAS may be a protective factor against an excessive cortisol response when people are under stress situations. Personality may be related to DHEAS reactivity.
Is atrial fibrillation hospitalization increased with short-term elevations in exposure to fine particulate air pollution?,"Unlike previously observed associations with ischemic heart disease events and heart failure hospitalizations using similar study design and approaches, this study found that hospitalization for AF was not significantly associated with elevations in short-term exposure to fine PM air pollution."
Does ranolazine reduce ventricular tachycardia burden and ICD shocks in patients with drug-refractory ICD shocks?,Ranolazine proved effective in reducing VT burden and ICD shocks in patients with AAD-refractory VT. Ranolazine should be further tested for this indication and considered for clinical application when other options have proven ineffective.
Is highly sensitive AFP-L3 % assay useful for predicting recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after curative treatment pre- and postoperatively?,"  The µTAS was found to be a highly sensitive assay for AFP-L3% in patients with curative treatment of HCC. A cutoff value of 5% was useful for predicting recurrence after the curative treatment and detecting small tumors and early stage HCC. Additionally, postoperative AFP-L3% was found to be a prognostic factor of HCC recurrence."
Is emotional distress associated with poor self care in type 2 diabetes mellitus?,"The present study demonstrates that psychosocial factors directly influence glycemic control and diabetes self-care habits. In addition, diabetes-specific distress in study population was unrelated to the duration of diabetes, the age of the patients and anthropometric indices."
Is c-reactive protein associated with aortic stiffness in a cohort of African American and white women transitioning through menopause?,"Menopause is strengthening the association between CRP and PWV, independent of age, and this effect seems to be stronger among African American women. This study provides a potential mechanism for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease among postmenopausal women."
Does exercise improve lung function and habitual activity in children with cystic fibrosis?,"Increases in exercise capacity over a two-month period resulted in significantly improved lung function and self-reported habitual activity. Longer, controlled trials are needed to develop individualized exercise recommendations."
Do serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation before liver transplantation predict decreased long-term recipient survival?,SF concentration ≥365 μg/L in combination with TFS <55% before LT is an independent risk factor for mortality following LT. Lower TFS combined with elevated SF concentrations indicate that acute phase mechanisms beyond iron overload may play a prognostic role. SF concentration therefore not only predicts pre-LT mortality but also death following LT.
Is the small GTPase Rap1 a novel regulator of RPE cell barrier function?,"Rap1 GTPase is an important regulator of RPE cell junctions, and is required for maintenance of barrier function. This observation that RPE monolayers lacking Rap1 allow greater transmigration of CECs suggests a possible role for potentiating choroidal neovascularization during the pathology of neovascular age-related macular degeneration."
Does anti-TNF-alpha therapy enhance the effects of enzyme replacement therapy in rats with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI?,"The results demonstrate that combining ERT with anti-TNF-alpha therapy improved the treatment outcome and led to significant clinical benefit. They also further validate the usefulness of TNF-alpha, RANKL and other inflammatory molecules as biomarkers for the MPS disorders. Further evaluation of this combination approach in other MPS animal models and patients is warranted."
Is comprehensive SNP array study of frequently used neuroblastoma cell lines ; copy neutral loss of heterozygosity common in the cell lines but uncommon in primary tumors?,"We have shown that the NB tumors analyzed contain several interesting allelic imbalances that would either go unnoticed or be misinterpreted using other genome-wide techniques. These findings indicate that the genetics underlying NB might be even more complex than previously known and that SNP arrays are important analysis tools. We have also showed that these near-CN-LOH events are more frequently seen in NB cell lines compared to NB tumors and that a set of highly related cell lines have continued to evolve secondary to the subcloning event. Taken together our analysis highlights that cell lines in many cases differ substantially from the primary tumors they are thought to represent, and that caution should be taken when drawing conclusions from cell line-based studies."
Does optimisation of atrioventricular delay during exercise improve cardiac output in patients stabilised with cardiac resynchronisation therapy?,"Haemodynamically optimal AV delay shortened progressively with increasing heart rate during exercise, which suggests the need for programming of rate-adaptive AV delay in CRT recipients."
Does frailty predict increased hospital and six-month healthcare cost following colorectal surgery in older adults?,"A simple, brief preoperative frailty assessment accurately forecasts increased surgical hospital costs and postdischarge to 6-month healthcare costs after colorectal operations in older adults."

Exposure to socioeconomic stressors for longer periods during childhood may further enhance alterations in immune response to cytomegalovirus."
Do urinary MMP-2 and MMP-9 predict the presence of ovarian cancer in women with normal CA125 levels?,This study demonstrates the potential utility of urinary MMP-2 and MMP-9 to differentiate between ovarian cancer patients with normal CA125 levels and controls and suggests that urinary MMP-2 and MMP-9 may be a clinically useful aid in the diagnosis of advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer.
Does the nature and correlate of avoidance in obsessive-compulsive disorder?,"Avoidance is common in OCD, and it is particularly frequently associated with contamination obsessions. There is a weak link between avoidance and hoarding and between avoidance and ordering/arranging/symmetry obsessions and compulsions. These results, along with the finding that OCD with avoidance is a more severe illness, have implications for the future diagnostic criteria, description, subtyping and treatment of OCD and for its relationship with other anxiety disorders."
Is gestational diabetes mellitus rare in primigravida Pakistani women?,Larger trials are needed to truly assess the disease burden of gestational diabetes mellitus in Pakistani women.
Does tDP-43 knockdown impair neurite outgrowth dependent on its target histone deacetylase 6?,"TDP-43 deficiency leads to impairment of neurite growth in an HDAC6-dependent manner, thereby contributing to neurodegenerative events in TDP-43 diseases."
Is transcriptional diversity at the UGT2B7 locus dictated by extensive pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms that give rise to multiple mRNA splice variants?,"Our findings point toward a significant variability in structure, abundance, and tissue-specific UGT2B7 transcriptome, in addition to novel functions for UGT2B7-derived proteins, all of which may ensure the production of tissue-specific proteomes and functions."
Does probe-based confocal laser microscopy identify criteria predictive of active celiac sprue?,"Probe-based CLM criteria developed in this pilot trial appear promising for the detection of active celiac sprue. Preliminary interobserver variability was high, indicating a learning curve effect. Our criteria need validation in an independent patient population."

Are antibodies recognising sulfated carbohydrates prevalent in systemic sclerosis and associated with pulmonary vascular disease?,Serum from patients with SSc contains IgG antibodies targeting distinct sulfated carbohydrates. The presence of anti-4S-LacNAc antibodies is associated with a high prevalence of pulmonary hypertension. These results suggest that specific post-translational carbohydrate modifications may act as important immunogens in SSc and may contribute to disease pathogenesis.
Is subclinical gut inflammation in spondyloarthritis associated with a pro-angiogenic intestinal mucosal phenotype?,A pro-angiogenic intestinal phenotype is observed in spondyloarthritis patients with quiescent chronic gut inflammation. This favours an environment for enhanced trafficking of immune cells in this subpopulation.
Does a combined molecular-pathologic score improve risk stratification of thyroid papillary microcarcinoma?,BRAF status together with several histopathologic features allowed clinical risk stratification of TPMCs. The combined MP risk stratification model was a better predictor of extrathyroid tumor spread than either mutation or histopathologic findings alone.
Does underestimation of Gleason score at prostate biopsy reflect sampling error in lower volume tumours?,"• Under-graded tumours are significantly smaller than tumours concordant for the higher grade, indicating that incomplete tumour sampling plays a significant role in Gleason score assignment error. • Surrogate measures of tumour volume may predict those at greatest risk of Gleason score upgrade."
Is paroxysmal atrial fibrillation more prevalent than persistent atrial fibrillation in acute stroke and transient ischemic attack patients?,"pxAF occurs more often than pAF in stroke/TIA patients. As effective stroke prevention is available for AF, it is important to develop and evaluate sensitive methods for detecting pxAF."
Is the microRNA-200 family upregulated in endometrial carcinoma?,"This information contributes to the candidate miRNA expression profile that has been generated for EEC and shows that certain miRNAs are dysregulated in the precursor lesion, CAH. These miRNAs in particular may play important roles in tumorigenesis. Examination of miRNAs that are consistently dysregulated in various studies of EEC, like the miR-200 family, will aid in the understanding of the role that miRNAs play in tumorigenesis in this tumour type."
Is irreversible electroporation a surgical ablation technique that enhances gene transfer?,"IRE is a promising technique not only for operative tissue ablation but also for gene therapy. Because IRE ablation may leave behind intact tumor antigens, these findings encourage clinical studies of tumor ablation with delivery of immunostimulatory plasmids for combined local eradication and systemic immunotherapy."
Is cryopreservation of blastocysts the most feasible strategy in good responder patients?,The feasible strategy in good responder patients appears to be the cryopreservation of blastocysts in the fresh cycle. Retardation in development results in a compromised outcome because of reduced inherent capacity of embryos.
Does the region of largest β-zone parapapillary atrophy area predict the location of most rapid visual field progression?,"In treated glaucoma patients with β-zone PPA and VF progression, the location of largest β-zone PPA typically correlates spatially with the region of the most rapid future VF progression."
Is loss of BRCA1 protein expression as indicator of the BRCAness phenotype associated with favorable overall survival after complete resection of sporadic ovarian cancer?,"Epithelial ovarian cancers with negative BRCA1 protein expression were identified in younger patients, showed a significantly better overall survival, prolonged treatment intervals and a tendency for an extended progression free time interval. BRCA1 IHC negativity of sporadic EOC may be predictive of sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and the poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase inhibitor-sensitive BRCAness phenotype."

Does toll-like receptor 9 agonist IMO cooperate with cetuximab in K-ras mutant colorectal and pancreatic cancers?,"We showed that IMO markedly inhibits growth of K-Ras mutant colon and pancreatic cancers in vitro and in nude mice and cooperates with cetuximab via multiple mechanisms of action. Therefore, we propose IMO plus cetuximab as a therapeutic strategy for K-Ras wild-type as well for K-Ras mutant, cetuximab-resistant colorectal and pancreatic cancers."
Do variations in truncal body circumferences affect fat mass quantification with bioimpedance analysis?,"Resistance changes associated with variations in trunk circumferences decrease resistance, and therefore impair the accuracy of BIA to assess %FM."
Do enterotoxin-producing staphylococci cause intestinal inflammation by a combination of direct epithelial cytopathy and superantigen-mediated T-cell activation?,"Staphylococci induce enterocolitis by a combination of direct enterocyte cytopathy mediated by EDIN toxins, disrupting the epithelial barrier, and enterotoxin superantigen-induced mucosal T-cell activation. Gut epithelial production of β-defensins may contribute to host defense against invasive staphylococcal disease."
Does deep sequencing of short RNAs reveal novel microRNAs in minor salivary glands of patients with Sjögren 's syndrome?,"Sequencing small RNAs in the salivary gland is largely unprecedented, but here, we show the feasibility of discovering novel miRNAs and disease biomarkers by sequencing the transcriptome."
Is regression of established hepatocellular carcinoma induced by chemoimmunotherapy in an orthotopic murine model?,"These findings indicate that sunitinib inhibits HCC tumor growth directly through the STAT3 pathway and prevents tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell tolerance, thus defining a synergistic chemoimmunotherapeutic approach for HCC."
"Is lactobacillus salivarius plus fructo-oligosaccharide superior to fructo-oligosaccharide alone for treating children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis : a double-blind , randomized , clinical trial of efficacy and safety?","A synbiotic combination of L. salivarius plus fructo-oligosaccharide is superior to the prebiotic alone for treating moderate to severe childhood AD. However, continued follow-up will be necessary to ascertain long-term benefits."
Does clotting factor concentrate given to prevent bleeding and bleeding-related complications in people with hemophilia A or B?,There is strong evidence from randomised controlled trials and observational trials that prophylaxis preserves joint function in children with hemophilia as compared to on-demand treatment. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to confirm the observational evidence that prophylaxis decreases bleeding and related complications in patients with existing joint damage. Well-designed randomised controlled trials and prospective observational controlled studies are needed to establish the best prophylactic regimen and to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic clotting factor concentrates in adult patients.

Do recurrent extrusion of cochlear implant at an interval of 5 years?,"The two extrusions occurred with a long interval in between and at two different sites. The first extrusion occurred along the skin incision, and the second extrusion occurred away from the skin incision with infection around the device. The authors assumed that the first and the second extrusion occurred independently; the first extrusion was caused by insufficient blood supply resulting from scar formation from repeated mastoid operations and by pressure on the skin from the internal and external devices, and the second extrusion was caused by proliferated tissue pushing the device upward and against the skin as a result of chronic middle ear infection. The clinical course indicates that sufficiently long follow-up periods are needed to determine the usefulness of the prevention techniques for cochlear implantation in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media."
Do contrast agents provide a faster learning curve in dipyridamole stress echocardiography?,The use of contrast agents provides a better agreement in the evaluation of stress echo between an experienced and a non-experienced observer in stress echo.

Do the cumulative effect of high click rate on monaural and binaural processing in the human auditory brainstem?,"The progressive prolongation of latency of ABEP and BIC components with advancing position in the train may be attributed to cumulatively decreased synaptic efficacy at high stimulus rates, resulting in prolonged synaptic delays along the auditory pathway. The paradoxic enhancement of ABEP dipole III magnitude with advancing click position in the train may reflect higher sensitivity of inhibitory brainstem neurons to increased stimulus rate, resulting in disinhibition. The absence of significant effects on BIC dipole magnitudes may reflect the amplifying effect of divergence in the ascending auditory pathway, as has been observed for the monaurally evoked ABEP components from the upper pons."
Does computer analysis of mFISH chromosome aberration data uncover an excess of very complicated metaphases?,"Standard models of DNA damage induction/repair/misrepair explain the main trends of the data as regards the fraction of metaphases having a particular number of colours involved in colour junctions. However, all standard models systematically under-predict the observed fraction of metaphases where a large number of different chromosomes participate in aberrations. An early appearance of chromosomal instability could explain most of the discrepancies."
Is hemodilution common in patients with advanced heart failure?,"Hemodilution is common in CHF patients. Anemia is associated with a poor prognosis in CHF.

We suggest that modulation of NPY Y1 and Y5 receptors may be a strategy to address the ethanol withdrawal conditions."
Is canonical Wnt signaling antagonized by noncanonical Wnt5a in hepatocellular carcinoma cells?,"Differential expression of Wnt ligands in HCC cells is associated with selective activation of canonical Wnt signaling in well-differentiated, and its repression in poorly differentiated cell lines. One potential mechanism of repression involved Wnt5a, acting as an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling. Our observations support the hypothesis that Wnt pathway is selectively activated or repressed depending on differentiation status of HCC cells. We propose that canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways have complementary roles in HCC, where the canonical signaling contributes to tumor initiation, and noncanonical signaling to tumor progression."
Does chronic kidney disease increase cardiovascular unfavourable outcomes in outpatients with heart failure?,"In this cohort of patients with CHF stages B and C, CKD was prevalent and independently associated with increased risk of hospitalization and death secondary to cardiac decompensation, especially in asymptomatic patients."
Do cHEK2 germline mutations correlate with recurrence rate in patients with superficial bladder cancer?,"The results indicate that patients with CHEK2 mutation may present poorer clinical course with several recurrences of SBC.

Does cT colonography predictably overestimate colonic length and distance to polyps compared with optical colonoscopy?,Anus-to-cecum and anus-to-polyp distances are disparate but comparable using a conversion factor of 0.57 for the CTC anus-to-cecum measurement and 0.59 for right-sided CTC anus-to-polyp or 0.78 for left-sided CTC anus-to-polyp measurements. These anus-to-polyp conversion factors could potentially augment current CTC guidelines for accurate and precise polyp localization and removal at endoscopy.
Is mechanism of lapatinib-mediated radiosensitization of breast cancer cells primarily by inhibition of the Raf > MEK > ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and radiosensitization of lapatinib-resistant cells restored by direct inhibition of MEK?,These data suggest that radiosensitization by lapatinib is mediated largely through inhibition of MEK/ERK and that direct inhibition of this pathway may provide an additional avenue of radiosensitization in EGFR+ or HER2+ breast cancers.
Is operator an independent predictor of detecting prostate cancer at transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy?,"Significant differences in prostate cancer detection exist among operators who perform transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy even in the same setting. The volume of previously performed transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies does not appear to influence the positive prostate cancer detection rate, nor could a learning curve be identified. Differences in prostate cancer detection among operators are likely related to unknown differences in expertise or technique. Further research is needed."

The magnitude of the treatment effect was clinically significant. Positive treatment effects were even found in those with advanced disease."
Does empirical evaluation suggest Copas selection model preferable to trim-and-fill method for selection bias in meta-analysis?,The assumption that the most extreme studies are missing leads to excessively conservative inference in practice for the trim-and-fill method. The Copas selection model appears to be the preferable approach.
Does a statistical model of protein sequence similarity and function similarity reveal overly-specific function predictions?,"Our model shows nearly exact function similarity for proteins with high sequence similarity (bit score >244.7, e-value >1e(-62), non-redundant NCBI protein database (NRDB)) and only small likelihood of specific function match for proteins with low sequence similarity (bit score <54.6, e-value <1e(-05), NRDB). For sequence similarity ranges in between our annotation model shows an increasing relationship between function similarity and sequence similarity, but with considerable variability. We applied the model to a large set of proteins of unknown function, and predicted functions for thousands of these proteins ranging from general to very specific. We also applied the model to a data set of proteins with previously assigned, specific functions that were electronically based. We show that, on average, these prior function predictions are more specific (quite possibly overly-specific) compared to predictions from our model that is based on proteins with experimentally determined function."

Does quantitative differences in sputum smear microscopy result for acid-fast bacilli by age and sex in four countries?,"Differences in the frequency of low-grade positivity between the four countries were striking. Females tended to have lower bacillary counts, and low-grade positivity was more frequent at the extremes of age. These results reinforce the need for appropriate instructions on how to produce high-quality sputum to improve yield."
Is hypothalamic FTO associated with the regulation of energy intake not feeding reward?,"We conclude that FTO mRNA is present mainly in sites related to hunger/satiation control; changes in hypothalamic FTO expression are associated with cues related to energy intake rather than feeding reward. In line with that, neurons involved in feeding termination express FTO. Interestingly, baseline FTO expression appears linked not only with energy intake but also energy metabolism."
Do cSF biomarkers predict rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease?,"At the time of diagnosis, a combination of high CSF tau without proportionally elevated p-tau-181 is associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline."
Is diabetes associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease?,"In a cohort of community-dwelling patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) was associated with a lower rate of cognitive decline.

Is pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast carcinoma associated with the disappearance of tumor-infiltrating foxp3+ regulatory T cells?,These findings indicate that pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with an immunologic profile combining the absence of immunosuppressive Foxp3 cells and the presence of a high number of CD8 T cells and cytotoxic cells. These results argue for the induction of an antitumor immune response by chemotherapy.
Are tissue microstructural changes independently associated with cognitive impairment in cerebral amyloid angiopathy?,Mean ADC is independently associated with preintracerebral hemorrhage cognitive impairment in CAA. The lack of correlation with other MRI markers of CAA suggests that mean ADC may be sensitive to distinct aspects of CAA pathology and its tissue consequences. These results suggest that global MRI diffusion changes are sensitive to clinically relevant microstructural alterations and may be useful markers of CAA-related tissue damage.
Does diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging allow monitoring of anticancer treatment effects in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas?,"DWI can be used as a supplement to morphologic imaging for the evaluation of tumor response to anticancer therapy in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas.

Does cannabis withdrawal predict severity of cannabis involvement at 1-year follow-up among treated adolescents?,"All three definitions of cannabis withdrawal demonstrated some concurrent validity. Only the four-symptom and latent class-derived definitions of withdrawal predicted severity of cannabis-related problems at 1-year follow-up. No cannabis withdrawal definition predicted frequency of use at follow-up. Further research is needed to determine the clinical utility and validity of the four-symptom definition, as well as alternative definitions of cannabis withdrawal, to inform revisions leading to DSM-V and ICD-11."
Does polaprezinc attenuate liver fibrosis in a mouse model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis?,"These results suggest that polaprezinc attenuates fibrosis in NASH by reducing inflammation and lipid peroxidation and, during a later phase, promoting fibrolysis via the inhibition of TIMP expression in the liver. Further investigation is required to clarify the clinical efficacy of polaprezinc in patients with NASH."

Does nicotinic signaling ameliorate acute bladder inflammation induced by protamine sulfate or cyclophosphamide?,"Acutely cyclophosphamide treatment results in a greater frank bladder inflammation model in mice than protamine sulfate. However, cholinergic signaling can inhibit inflammation by either mechanism of induced bladder injury. Interleukin-6 gene expression is present and it can be regulated by afferent neuronal signaling even in the absence of observed histological changes in acute bladder inflammatory models."
"Are triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome and syndactyly type IV caused by genomic duplications involving the long range , limb-specific SHH enhancer?","Both TPTPS and SD4 are due to duplications involving ZRS, the limb specific SHH enhancer. Point mutations in the ZRS and duplications encompassing the ZRS cause distinctive limb phenotypes."

Are mDM2 SNP 309 and p53 codon 72 polymorphisms associated with the outcome of oral carcinoma patients receiving postoperative irradiation?,Advanced OSCC has high mortality and recurrence. We identified that both MDM2 SNP309 and p53 codon 72 SNP could be useful factors for evaluating the outcome of advanced OSCC treated with adjuvant radiation.
"Is breast cancer subtype approximated by estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , and HER-2 associated with local and distant recurrence after breast-conserving therapy?","Overall, the 5-year local recurrence rate after BCT was low, but varied by subtype as approximated using ER, PR, and HER-2 status. Local recurrence was particularly low for the luminal A subtype, but was less than 10% at 5 years for all subtypes. Although further follow-up is needed, these results may be useful in counseling patients about their anticipated outcome after BCT."
Are endometriosis of the ureter and bladder associated diseases?,"Ureter endometriosis is not associated with the bladder disease; however, it is associated with advanced ASRM stages and with retrocervical and rectum-sigmoid lesions."
Do virtual reality pain control during burn wound debridement in the hydrotank?,"Results provide the first available evidence from a controlled study that immersive VR can be an effective nonpharmacologic pain reduction technique for burn patients experiencing severe to excruciating pain during wound care. The potential applications of VR analgesia to other painful procedures (eg, movement or exercise therapy) and other pain populations are discussed."

Does tobacco smoking and depression -- result from the WHO/ISBRA study?,This study adds support to the evidence that smoking is linked to depression. It also elucidates the importance of taking into account alcohol and cocaine dependence since they have a significant impact on the relationship between smoking and depression.
Is val158Met polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) gene associated with tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenia?,"These results suggest that the V158M SNP of the COMT gene is not associated with TD in schizophrenia. However, there is a tendency that the heterozygous genotype of the COMT gene polymorphism has a protective effect against TD. Further investigations are warranted to evaluate a molecular heterosis of this polymorphism in development of TD in a large sample of subjects."
Is change in prostate specific antigen following androgen stimulation an independent predictor of prostate cancer diagnosis?,"An increase in prostate specific antigen following androgen stimulation in men with prostate specific antigen between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/ml was highly predictive of the subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer and it correlated with disease volume. If these findings are corroborated, prostate specific antigen provocation may become an important strategy to identify men at risk for harboring prostate cancer and minimize the number undergoing unnecessary biopsies."
Does practical approach to proteomic biomarkers within prostate cancer radiotherapy trials?,"Numerous proteomic methods are being employed, including high-throughput mass spectrometry and immunoassays, and using solid tissues, blood and urine for analysis. Given the potential complexity of cytokine and other protein responses, there is a need to assess proteomic signatures within serial samples as longitudinal studies during a course of fractionated radiotherapy (RT)."
Is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) a major personal and public health burden in Australia?,The reduction of the burden from COPD is contingent upon a proactive approach by public health that includes approaching it as a research priority and the provision of adequately resourced prevention and management strategies.
Do machine learning classifiers detect subtle field defects in eyes of HIV individuals?,"This study has confirmed that low-CD4 eyes have visual field defects and retinal damage. Ranking located important field locations superiorly near the blind spot, implying damage to the retina inferiorly near the optic disc. Though most fields appear normal in high-CD4 eyes, SVM and RVM were sufficiently sensitive to distinguish these eyes from normal eyes with SAP. The location of these defects is not yet defined. These results also validate the use of sensitive MLC techniques to uncover test differences not discernible by human experts."
Does trkB gene transfer alter hippocampal neuronal loss and cognitive deficits following traumatic brain injury in mice?,"These data suggest that neither overexpression of trkB, BNDF infusion or their combination affects neuronal survival or behavioral outcome following experimental TBI in mice."
Are management of knee osteoarthritis in primary care : pain and depression the major obstacles?,"A complex interrelationship between depression, pain, disease knowledge, and physical ability in patients with knee OA has been demonstrated. Specifically, the treatment of depression and pain may be paramount to the successful treatment of knee OA, and these factors should be considered in each patient and management priorities made."
Does desmocollin expression in oral atrophic lichen planus correlate with clinical behavior and DNA content?,"In atrophic OLP, desmocollin-1 is a powerful predictor of an important intermediate endpoint marker (dysplasia) in the causal pathway toward oral cancer."
Do black and white female adolescents lose vitamin D metabolites into urine?,"Urinary loss of vitamin D metabolites may be one cause of low vitamin D status, in addition to low dietary intake and reduced skin synthesis."

Do orthodontic adhesives induce human gingival fibroblast toxicity and inflammation?,"The hypothesis is rejected. For orthodontic patients with gingival inflammation, except for those with oral hygiene problems, the activation of COX-2 expression by orthodontic adhesive may be one of the potential mechanisms."
Is lactate concentration in umbilical cord blood gestational age-dependent : a population-based study of 17 867 newborns?,Lactate concentrations in arterial and venous umbilical cord blood are increasing significantly with advancing gestational age.
Are poor visualization during direct laryngoscopy and high upper lip bite test score predictors of difficult intubation with the GlideScope videolaryngoscope?,"Despite a high success rate, intubation with the GlideScope is likely to be more challenging in patients with high Cormack and Lehane grade during direct laryngoscopy, high upper lip bite test score, or short sternothyroid distance."
Do a review of irritable bowel syndrome and an update on therapeutic approaches?,"The therapeutic options for irritable bowel syndrome are rapidly evolving beyond traditional symptom-based therapies, such as fiber, antispasmodics, antidiarrheals and laxatives and are moving towards agents with organ-specific receptor selectivity directed, in many cases, at specific gastrointestinal functions."
Do tumor necrosis factor-alpha and endothelial cells modulate Notch signaling in the bone marrow microenvironment during inflammation?,Our results provide the first evidence that BM endothelial cells promote expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells by a Notch-dependent mechanism and that TNF-alpha and LPS can modulate the levels of Notch ligand expression and Notch activation in the BM microenvironment in vivo.
"Does danqi Piantan Jiaonang modify hemostasis , hematology , and biochemistry in normal subjects and stroke patients?","DPJ does not significantly modify hematological, hemostatic, and biochemical parameters in normal subjects and stroke patients."
Is sustained weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass characterized by down regulation of endocannabinoids and mitochondrial function?,"The attenuated caloric intake, reduced food efficiency, and normalization of hormonal levels on day 28 post-RYGB were associated with significant down-regulation of endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in muscle and liver, respectively. These results suggest a role for endocannabinoids in the mechanism of sustained weight loss and RYGB success, and may have implications for treatment of morbid obesity."

Is experience enough : repeated breaches in epidural anesthesia aseptic technique by novice operators despite improved skill?,"Manual skills for invasive procedures improved with increasing experience, but aseptic technique did not, despite formal teaching. These findings reflect major gaps in the understanding and teaching of the principles of aseptic technique, most likely due to lack of structured training. Educational initiatives are needed to correct these teaching gaps."
Do expanded risk groups help determine which prostate radiotherapy sub-group may benefit from adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy?,There appears to be no advantage to ADT where the Gleason score is 6 or less and PSA is 15 or less. ADT is beneficial in patients treated to standard dose radiation with Gleason 6 disease and a PSA greater than 15 or where the Gleason score is 7 or higher.
Does a novel splice-site mutation of TULP1 underlie severe early-onset retinitis pigmentosa in a consanguineous Israeli Muslim Arab family?,"To date, 22 distinct pathogenic mutations of TULP1 have been reported in patients with early-onset RP or Leber congenital amaurosis. Here we report a novel splice-site mutation of TULP1, c.1495+2_1495+3insT, underlying autosomal recessive early-onset RP in a consanguineous Israeli Muslim Arab family. This report expands the spectrum of pathogenic mutations of the TULP1 gene."
Do high prevalence of hearing disorders at the Special Olympics indicate need to screen persons with intellectual disability?,"The screening reliably detects hearing disorders among persons with ID. The prevalence of hearing impairment in this population is considerably higher than in the general population, and the proportion of undetected hearing impairments is large, even among people with only mild and moderate ID, as examined in this study. Therefore, a screening is highly recommended, and special attention from caregivers and professionals as well as regular hearing assessment and standard therapy programmes are required for persons with ID."
Does patient gender affect skin cancer screening practices and attitudes among veterans?,"We found low rates of SCS in both male and female veterans in different clinic settings at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Female veterans are less likely to report undergoing FBSE and more likely than male veterans to perform self-examination for skin cancer, to report embarrassment with FBSE, and refuse FBSE if the examining physician is of the opposite gender."

Does rANKL inhibition with osteoprotegerin increase bone strength by improving cortical and trabecular bone architecture in ovariectomized rats?,"OPG treatment prevented bone loss, preserved trabecular architecture, and increased cortical area and bone strength in OVX rats."
Does ultrasound guidance improve the success of sciatic nerve block at the popliteal fossa?,"Ultrasound guidance enhances the quality of popliteal sciatic nerve block compared with single injection, nerve stimulator-guided block using either a tibial or peroneal endpoint. Ultrasound guidance resulted in higher success, faster onset, and progression of sensorimotor block, without an increase in block procedure time, or complications."
Is microRNA profiling in hepatocellular tumors associated with clinical features and oncogene/tumor suppressor gene mutations?,"Hepatocellular tumors may have a distinct miRNA expression fingerprint according to malignancy, risk factors, and oncogene/tumor suppressor gene alterations. Dissecting these relationships provides a new hypothesis to understand the functional impact of miRNA deregulation in liver tumorigenesis and the promising use of miRNAs as diagnostic markers."
Do acute kidney injury criteria predict outcomes of critically ill patients?,"The Acute Kidney Injury Network definition of acute kidney injury predicts hospital mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, and prolonged hospital stay in critically ill patients. An increment of serum creatinine > or = 0.3 mg/dL in 48 hrs alone predicts clinical outcomes as well as the full Acute Kidney Injury Network definition."
Are patient expectations always the same?,"The factorial structure of expectations varied, indicating that expectations are not homogeneous in all clinical situations. The desire of the patient to participate in decision-making also differs according to the type of health problem."
Do adult attachment and social support interact to reduce psychological but not cortisol responses to stress?,"This first study on the interaction of adult attachment and social support in terms of psychological and endocrine stress responses concurs with previous studies suggesting an important protective role of attachment for psychological stress responsiveness. However, attachment did not directly moderate cortisol responses to acute stress."
Does traditional Chinese drug ShuXueTong facilitate angiogenesis during wound healing following traumatic brain injury?,The mechanism of the therapeutic effect of ShuXueTong on traumatic brain injury lies at least partly in the enhanced angiogenesis in the lesion.
Do truncated power laws reveal a link between low-level behavioral processes and grouping patterns in a colonial bird?,Appropriate analysis of the scaling properties of grouping patterns has unraveled the link between local agonistic processes and large-scale (population) grouping patterns in a wild bird population.
Does platelet-delivered factor VIII provide limited resistance to anti-factor VIII inhibitors?,"In FVIII(null) mice, pFVIII provides improved, but limited, protection in the presence of inhibitors of approximately 6-fold greater Bethesda Units per mL relative to infused FVIII. Our findings differ from a recent report using a tail-clip exsanguination assay on the degree of efficacy of pFVIII in the presence of inhibitors. We propose that this difference in outcome is as a result of the sensitivity of the tail-vein exsanguination model to low levels of pFVIII."
Are endothelial dysfunction and carotid lesions strong predictors of clinical events in patients with early stages of atherosclerosis : a 24-month follow-up study?,"In this study, endothelial dysfunction and carotid lesions significantly increased the risk of vascular events in asymptomatic patients with early stages of atherosclerosis. Assessment of systemic vasoreactivity and carotid IMT evaluation may provide, in this category of patients, important prognostic information in addition to that derived from traditional established cardiovascular risk factors."
Does elevated body mass index ( BMI ) adversely affect in vitro fertilization outcome in young women?,Obesity in young women does not adversely affect clinical pregnancy rates in patients treated with in vitro fertilization.
Does catechol-O-methyltransferase contribute to genetic susceptibility shared among anxiety spectrum phenotypes?,Variations in the COMT gene contribute to genetic risk shared across a range of anxiety-related phenotypes.
Do serum markers support disease-specific glial pathology in major depression?,"As the study measured only serum S100B, future (cell culture) studies have to elucidate molecular mechanisms of this protein in mood disorders. Moreover, results have to be replicated in a larger patient group."
"Is impact of posterior subcapsular opacification on vision and visual function among subjects undergoing cataract surgery in rural China : Study of Cataract Outcomes and Up-Take of Services ( SCOUTS ) in the Caring Hip Project , report 5?","The prevalence of PCO and impact on vision and visual function in this cohort was modest 1 year after surgery.

Follow-up of this cohort is underway to determine the effectiveness of this early intervention in identifying and treating subjects who will eventually experience clinically significant PCO."
Is the circadian defect in plasma vasopressin and urine output related to desmopressin response and enuresis status in children with nocturnal enuresis?,"In addition to providing further pathophysiological support for the role of a nocturnal arginine vasopressin deficiency behind nocturnal polyuria in a subset of patients with enuresis, the results emphasize the clinical value of estimating nocturnal urine production on wet nights before selecting a therapeutic modality."
Does the p.Val66Met polymorphism in the BDNF gene protect against early seizures in Rett syndrome?,"Early onset of seizures is linked to the combined MECP2 and BDNF genotypes. The BDNF Met66 allele may protect against seizures, whereas missense mutations in the MBD of MECP2 are more frequently associated with early seizures."
Is the baseline ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes associated with patient prognosis in advanced gastric cancer?,These results suggest that the N/L ratio is an independent prognostic factor in advanced gastric cancer. Measurement of this ratio may serve as a clinically accessible and useful biomarker for patient survival.
Does preoperative assessment enable the early diagnosis and successful treatment of lymphedema?,A short trial of compression garments effectively treated subclinical LE.
Does filamentous middle cerebral artery occlusion cause ischemic damage to the retina in mice?,"Sixty minutes fMCAO produces retinal injury in SV129EV mice. Potential visual dysfunction should be considered when a particular occlusion period is selected for studying neurological outcomes after fMCAO. Because visual disturbance is often associated with thrombotic/embolic stroke in humans, fMCAO represents an appropriate model for future studies aimed at understanding and ameliorating the changes that lead to retinal damage in these patients."
Is expression of mammaglobins A and B in nasal polyps similar in patients with and without allergic rhinitis?,Expression levels of mammaglobins A and B in nasal polyps are not different between patients with and without AR. Our findings suggest that mammaglobins' implication in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps is independent of an underlying AR.
Is hepatocellular carcinoma associated with an increased risk of hepatitis B virus recurrence after liver transplantation?,"The associations of HCC pre-OLT, and HCC recurrence with HBV recurrence post-OLT, and the detection of HBV DNA and cccDNA in HCC suggest that HBV replication in tumor cells may contribute to HBV recurrence post-OLT."

Does gait reveal bilateral adaptation of motor control in patients with chronic unilateral stroke?,"Patients chose their preferred walking velocity using stereotyped, alternative gait patterns, in which the contribution of the NS was larger than that of the AS. Alternative gait patterns may partly demonstrate compensatory behavioral strategies adapted by patients."
Is distractor P3 associated with attentional capture by stimulus deviance?,"Distractor P3 reflects attentional capture by stimulus deviance, rather than cognitive interference with maintaining the standard representation."
Do th2 cytokines associated with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps down-regulate the antimicrobial immune function of human sinonasal epithelial cells?,Expression of multiple innate immune genes by HSNEC is reduced in CRSwNP. One mechanism appears to be a direct effect of the leukocyte-derived Th2 cytokines present in the sinonasal mucosa in CRSwNP. Impaired mucosal innate immunity may contribute to microbial colonization and abnormal immune responses associated with CRSwNP.
Do dendritic cell-based vaccines suppress metastatic liver tumor via activation of local innate and acquired immunity?,"These results demonstrate that unpulsed DC vaccines might serve as an effective therapy for treating metastatic liver tumor, for which TAA has not yet been identified."
Does lumbar support for prevention and treatment of low back pain?,"There is moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and conflicting evidence whether they are effective supplements to other preventive interventions. It remains unclear whether lumbar supports are more effective than no or other interventions for treating low-back pain. There is still a need for high quality randomized trials on the effectiveness of lumbar supports. One of the most essential issues to tackle in these future trials seems to be the realization of an adequate compliance. Special attention should be paid to different outcome measures, types of patients and types of lumbar support."
Is postoperative peritoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer cells promoted by carbon-dioxide pneumoperitoneum at low intraperitoneal pressure in a syngenic mouse laparoscopic model with controlled respiratory support : a pilot study?,Postoperative peritoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer cells is not promoted by a carbon-dioxide pneumoperitoneum with a low IPP in a mouse model with CRS when assessed on postoperative day 14.
Is iron supplementation of iron-replete Indonesian infants associated with reduced weight-for-age?,"In our study, iron supplementation of IR infants affected WAZ adversely, whereas iron supplementation to non-iron-replete infants did not affect growth. These results support a cautious approach to iron supplementation of IR infants."
Does organic elemental composition in fingernail plates vary between sexes and changes with increasing age in healthy humans?,"Results suggest that the N/S ratio is indicative of sex differences and the C/N ratio of aging in healthy humans. The increasing carbon content with ongoing age could be explained by loss of inorganic material from the nails, followed by a subsequent increase of organic material. The increasing C/N ratio gives evidence that keratin composition changes towards a higher amount of alpha-amino acids with aging."
Does developmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls influence stroke outcome in adult rats?,Our data provide proof of principle that developmental exposures to environmental contaminants influence the response of the adult brain to ischemic injury and thus represent potentially important determinants of stroke susceptibility.
Does ultrasonographic guidance improve the success rate of interscalene brachial plexus blockade?,The use of ultrasound to guide needle placement and monitor the spread of local anesthetic improves the success rate of interscalene brachial plexus block.
Do urinary biomarkers predict brain tumor presence and response to therapy?,"We report, for the first time, the identification of a panel of urinary biomarkers that predicts the presence of brain tumors. These biomarkers correlate with presence of disease, decrease with treatment, and can be tracked from source tissue to urine. These data support the hypothesis that urinary MMPs and associated proteins are useful predictors of the presence of brain tumors and may provide a basis for a novel, noninvasive method to identify new brain tumors and monitor known tumors after treatment."
Is ascaris lumbricoides-induced interleukin-10 associated with atopy in schoolchildren in a rural area of the tropics?,The results of this study do not support the notion that IL-10 plays a role in modulating atopy in children living in a tropical area where intestinal helminth infections are endemic.
Is surgeon experience strongly associated with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy for all preoperative risk categories?,Cancer control after radical prostatectomy improves with increasing surgeon experience irrespective of patient risk. Excellent rates of cancer control in patients with low risk disease treated by the most experienced surgeons suggest that the primary reason that recurrence develops in such patients is inadequate surgical technique. The results have significant implications for clinical care.

Are intra-abdominal fat and metabolic syndrome associated with larger infrarenal aortic diameters in patients with clinically evident arterial disease?,Intra-abdominal fat accumulation and metabolic syndrome are associated with larger infrarenal aortic diameters in patients with clinically evident arterial disease. These data may indicate a role for intra-abdominal fat in the development of larger aortic diameters.
Do standard antiepileptic drugs fail to block epileptiform activity in rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures?,We present a simple to establish in vitro model of tonic-clonic SLEs that is a priori pharmacoresistant and thus has an advantage over animal models of pharmacoresistant seizures in which responders and non-responders can be sorted out only after an experiment. OHSCs could be suitable for exploring mechanisms of pharmacoresistant seizures and be used for the identification of new anticonvulsive compounds eventually effective in drug refractory epilepsy.

Does interleukin-6 receptor superantagonist Sant7 inhibit TGF-beta-induced proliferation of human lung fibroblasts?,"These findings suggest that, in HLFs derived from patients with ILDs, the proliferative mechanisms activated by TGF-beta1 are at least in part mediated by an increased release of IL-6, leading to phosphorylation-dependent MAPK activation. Such preliminary findings may thus open new therapeutic perspectives for fibrogenic ILDs, based on inhibition of signal transduction pathways stimulated by the IL-6 receptor."
Does selective activation of muscle and skin nociceptors trigger exaggerated sympathetic responses in spinal-injured subjects?,"While hypertonic saline injected into muscle or skin induces strong pain, cutaneous vasoconstriction and sweat release in able-bodied subjects, we saw no evidence of exaggerated sympathoexcitation when these same noxious stimuli were delivered below lesion in subjects with SCI. This suggests that certain types of somatic noxious input may not trigger autonomic dysreflexia, and questions the concept that any painful stimuli originating below lesion can reliably trigger dysreflexia."
Does use of the ThinPrep Imaging System alter the frequency of interpreting Papanicolaou tests as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance?,Use of the ThinPrep Imaging System did not appreciably change ASC-US rates or follow-up reflex HPV test results in our laboratory. This demonstrates that the benefits of automated screening may be obtained without increasing the rate of referral to colposcopy for ASC-US follow-up.
Are hand function tests important and sensitive tools for assessment of treatment response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis?,Patients with advanced RA attained considerable improvement in hand function that was only partly reflected by measures of general disability and disease activity. Focused assessment of hand function is therefore important for optimal evaluation of treatment response.
Are treatment expectancy and credibility associated with the outcome of both physical and cognitive-behavioral treatment in chronic low back pain?,"Although the associations found were low to modest, these results underscore the importance of expectancy and credibility for the outcome of different active interventions for CLBP and might contribute to the development of more effective treatments."
Does [ Validity of information relevant to research in routine medication claim data from 2000 to 2006 ]?,The accuracy of variables analysed in this study is very good for those which are immediately related to the flow of money in German out-patient medication claims data. Recording of dates of prescription and dispensing are fairly good quality.
Does innovative web-based multimedia curriculum improve cardiac examination competency of residents?,A Web-based interactive educational program with minimal hospitalist involvement led to significant improvement in CE competence and was better than clinical training alone.
Does [ Recurrence of Crohn 's disease after surgery -- cause and risks ]?,"On the basis of defined risk factors, patients with a high risk for recurrence can be identified. This is very important because of the higher risk for complications caused by reoperations compared to primary procedures. That is why interdisciplinary cooperation including postoperative care and optimal conservative treatment are absolutely essential."
Do hepatic macrophages promote the neutrophil-dependent resolution of fibrosis in repairing cholestatic rat livers?,"We conclude that the macrophage population is not directly involved in fibrotic liver repair. Rather, hepatic macrophages regulate the influx of neutrophils, which may play a direct role in matrix degradation."
Does differential gene profiling in acute lung injury identify injury-specific gene expression?,"These results demonstrate the application of functional genomics to the molecular ""fingerprinting"" of acute lung injury and the potential for decoupling biophysical from biochemical injury."
Does addition of rituximab to chop increase the risk of cardiotoxicity in patients with non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma?,Both CHOP and R-CHOP cause diastolic dysfunction in the early period following their administration. The addition of rituximab to CHOP chemotherapy does not significantly increase the risk of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity during this period.
Does the lung-to-thorax transverse area ratio at term and near term correlate with survival in isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia?,"In fetuses with isolated CDH at term or near term, the L/T ratio may be a better predictor of outcome than the L/H ratio or liver herniation."
Are polymorphisms in the brain-specific thyroid hormone transporter OATP1C1 associated with fatigue and depression in hypothyroid patients?,"OATP1C1 polymorphisms are associated with fatigue and depression, but do not explain differences in neurocognitive functioning or appreciation of LT4-LT3 combination therapy. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings."
Does mRI estimation of total renal volume demonstrate significant association with healthy donor weight?,"Body weight was the physical characteristic which demonstrated the strongest correlation with renal volume in healthy subjects.

Does an angiotensin II receptor antagonist reduce myocardial damage in an animal model of myocarditis?,"This study suggests that angiotensin II plays an important pathophysiological role in viral myocarditis. Treatment with TCV-116, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, had a cardioprotective effect."
Is long-term histologic patency after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty predicted by the creation of a greater lumen area?,"Neointimal proliferation after angioplasty occurs in all dilated coronary arteries, and the amount of neointimal growth is independent of vessel size. The creation of a larger lumen and a larger lumen as a percent of vessel size were associated with an improved long-term histologic patency."
Is a missense mutation in the beta myosin heavy chain gene a predictor of premature sudden death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"The missense mutation in exon 13 of the beta MHC gene in individuals with FHCM is associated with high penetrance, highly variable expressivity, severe disease, early in onset and a high incidence of premature sudden death. Based on these results we recommend individuals from families with HCM be screened for this missense mutation and if positive, be counselled to avoid combative sports, as it is these activities that often precipitate sudden death."
Does physiological factors associated with fall in older community-dwelling women?,These findings support previous results conducted in retirement village and institutional setting and indicate that the test procedure aids in the identification of older community-dwelling women at risk of falls.
Do coronary angiographic findings predict clinical outcome in patients with unstable angina?,"In this selected group of patients with unstable angina, type of coronary artery lesion and the presence or absence of thrombus formation does not predict clinical outcome."
Does microflora modulate endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal mucosa of the rat?,Our findings suggest that the intraluminal microflora influences the release of biologically active peptides and that it participates in the regulation of gastrointestinal endocrine cells and the epithelial structure.
Is mathematical examination of dual individualization principles ( II ) : The rate of bacterial eradication at the same area under the inhibitory curve more rapid for ciprofloxacin than for cefmenoxime?,"We conclude that the more rapid in vitro bacterial killing, which is characteristic of ciprofloxacin at optimal AUIC values, can manifest in vivo as more rapid clearance of bacteria from the respiratory tract of patients, even when both agents are controlled for initial antibacterial exposure (i.e., same AUIC)."
Do long-term kidney isografts develop functional and morphologic changes that mimic those of chronic allograft rejection?,Antigen-independent functional and morphologic changes occur in long-term kidney isografts that resemble those appearing considerably earlier in allografts that reject chronically. Initial injury and extent of functioning renal mass may be important factors for such late changes.
Is immunoreactive tumor necrosis factor-alpha elevated in maternal plasma but undetected in amniotic fluid in the second trimester?,"Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha were elevated in the plasma but not detected in the amniotic fluid of normal pregnant patients in the second trimester. These findings suggest involvement of the cellular branch of the immune system and its products, the cytokines, in the normal adaptation of the mother to the fetal allograft, with a possible role in regulating trophoblast growth and invasion."
Are increased interleukin-6 concentrations in cervical secretions associated with preterm delivery?,"Cervical interleukin-6 is a relatively insensitive, although fairly specific discriminator of patients with subsequent preterm deliveries. Among patients delivered preterm, elevated cervical interleukin-6 values are not apparently associated with maternal infectious morbidity."
Do psychiatric disorders in and service use by young homeless people?,"Young people with experience of homelessness have a high prevalence of depressive disorders and substance use disorders, particularly alcohol and cannabis dependence. Despite this they have a low rate of service use. These findings suggest a need for closer interaction between mental health professionals and other agencies in the planning and provision of services to young homeless people."
Is the rate of increase in blood pressure in children 5 years of age related to changes in aerobic fitness and body mass index?,Young children who increase their aerobic fitness or decrease their body mass index reduce the rate of the age-related increase in blood pressure. These observations may have implications for development of interventions directed at the primary prevention of hypertension.

Does emotionally expressive coping reduce pregnancy rates in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization?,The link between psychological processes and reproductive outcomes of IVF treatment is less likely to be identified through the assessment of stress but rather is likely to be identified through the assessment of the strategies that people use to deal with stress. Emotionally expressive coping may be a risk factor for reduced pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF.
Does increase in incidence of hyperthyroidism predominantly occur in young people after iodine fortification of salt in Denmark?,"Even a cautious iodization of salt results in an increase in the incidence rate of hyperthyroidism. Contrary to current concepts, many of the new cases were observed in young subjects, and are presumably of autoimmune origin. Furthermore, monitoring is expected to show a decrease in the number of elderly subjects suffering from nodular hyperthyroidism."

Does nonlinear association of higher-level functional capacity with the incidence of fall in Japan?,We have proposed the use of nonlinear model in estimating the incidence of falls with respect to the total score of the TMIG index of competence. The association of varying total score with the incidence of falls in women diverged from the linearity assumption. The gender-based difference in the association of higher-level functional capacity with the incidence of falls might be related to societal role or activity-related aspects.
Is the number of Baby Friendly hospital practices experienced by mothers positively associated with breastfeeding : a questionnaire survey?,"This study found a dose-response relationship between number of 10-step practices experienced and breastfeeding. However, very few women in Taiwan reported experiencing all 10 steps. Our findings highlight the need for greater attention to implement the 10 steps."
Does metformin influence cardiomyocyte cell death by pathways that are dependent and independent of caspase-3?,"Our study demonstrates that metformin reduces high-fat-induced cardiac cell death, probably through inhibition of ceramide synthesis. However, at high concentrations, metformin causes proton and lactate accumulation, leading to cell damage that is independent of caspase-3."
Does dementia severity of the care receiver predict procoagulant response in Alzheimer caregivers?,"Dementia severity of the care recipient was associated with increasing hypercoagulability among elderly caregivers. Effect size estimates suggest that such D-dimer increases may have clinical implications, particularly among late-stage caregivers."
Does melanin differentially protect from the initiation and progression of threshold UV-induced erythema depending on UV waveband?,"Melanin situated near the basal epidermis may not protect from the initial development of threshold erythema caused by 290 nm UV because it penetrates poorly past the stratum corneum and is not well absorbed by melanin in vivo compared with 310 nm UV. Higher erythemal 290 nm UV doses may reach basal epidermal melanin, which may then afford protection against further 290 nm UV erythema."
Does magnetic resonance quantitative myocardial perfusion reserve demonstrate improved myocardial blood flow after angiogenic implant therapy?,Quantitative MR myocardial first pass perfusion imaging can be used to track the development of angiogenesis as corroborated by radioactive microspheres. Angiogenic implant therapy is a new device based therapy that has potential to protect an ischemic region by accelerating angiogenesis although further research is necessary with this device.
Is pattern of invasion of prognostic value in surgically treated cervical cancer patients?,"Spray-like PI (i.e., highest degree of tumor cell dissociation) is associated with advanced tumor stages, increased rate of recurrency and a reduced overall survival. In separate analysis of patients with and without lymph node metastases, the impact of PI persisted only in node-negative cases as a prognostic factor."
Is a brain-behaviour initiative for South Africa : the time right?,"There is a need to apprise policy-makers in developing world countries such as South Africa of the need for increased expenditure on basic and clinical neuroscience research. Local and international collaboration may be useful in increasing research capacity in South Africa, and ultimately in improving mental health services."
Is megakaryocyte potentiation factor cleaved from mesothelin precursor a useful tumor marker in the serum of patients with mesothelioma?,"Using new mAbs to MPF, we showed that MPF is secreted by several mesothelioma cell lines and is frequently elevated in the blood of patients with mesothelioma. Measurement of MPF may be useful in following the response of mesothelioma to treatment."
Is sjogren 's syndrome associated with and not secondary to systemic sclerosis?,"SS seems to be associated with and not secondary to SSc. SS associated with SSc has the same features as pSS, but SSc seems to be less serious. Moreover, the association of SS and SSc is frequently accompanied by a spreading of autoimmunity."
Are alanine amino transferase concentrations linked to folate intakes and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism in obese adolescent girls?,Our data suggest that folate intake and the MTHFR polymorphism represent a part of the link between antioxidant status and liver disease in obese adolescent girls.
"Is lower bone mineral content in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus linked to female sex , low insulin-like growth factor type I levels , and high insulin requirement?",A sex-related difference in the impairment of bone mineral characteristics was identified in children with T1DM.

Further studies are required to assess the behavior of other antioxidant enzymes to highlight potential benefits of regular exercise in redox metabolism.
Do food group adherence scores assess food patterns compared to US Department of Agriculture Food Guide?,"Results suggest adherence to the USDA Food Guide decreases with increasing age in young children in the United States. Adherence scores may be a useful tool to describe adherence to the new USDA Food Guide. These scores could be used in program evaluation, surveillance, and epidemiological studies of diet and health."
Do catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) gene variants predict response to bupropion therapy for tobacco dependence?,"COMT haplotypes at rs737865 and rs165599 may predict a favorable outcome for bupropion treatment for smoking cessation. European-American smokers with a G allele at both SNPs may not benefit from bupropion treatment. Small numbers of some COMT haplotypes limit interpretation of response. If study findings are confirmed in additional large studies, COMT genotyping could be applied to identify likely responders to bupropion treatment for smoking cessation."
Does prenatal cannabis exposure increase heroin seeking with allostatic changes in limbic enkephalin systems in adulthood?,This study demonstrates enduring effects of prenatal THC exposure into adulthood that is evident on heroin-seeking behavior during extinction and allostatic changes in mesocorticolimbic PENK systems relevant to drug motivation/reward and stress response.
Does deletion of p47phox attenuate angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm formation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice?,"Deletion of p47phox attenuates Ang II-induced AAA formation in apoE-/- mice, suggesting that NADPH oxidase plays a critical role in AAA formation in this model."
Are radiation-associated endometrial cancers prognostically unfavorable tumors : a clinicopathologic comparison with 527 sporadic endometrial cancers?,"The clinicopathologic characteristics of RAECs, which include a preponderance of high-stage, high-grade and high-risk histologic subtypes, indicate that these tumors differ from sporadic endometrial carcinomas. However, patients with RAECs do not appear to have a significantly worse prognosis when compared with patients with high-stage and high-grade sporadic cancers."
Does admission ECG predict long-term outcome in acute coronary syndromes without ST elevation?,"Rates of adverse events are high in patients admitted to UK hospitals with ACS without ST elevation. The ECG remains a very important and simple discriminator of both short- and long-term risk, enabling more aggressive, proven therapies to be targeted towards those at highest risk."
Is fetal brain sparing strongly related to the degree of increased placental vascular impedance?,A clear correlation exists between increasing placental vascular impedance and BS in the MCA. Preterm pregnancies express the greatest deviation from the mean MCA PI.
Does parent 's Evaluation of Developmental Status ( PEDS ) detect developmental problems compared to Denver II?,"PEDS could play a role in detection of developmental problems but was not a good tool in screening. Therefore, significant concerns of parents about their children's development are the critical information for referral to have further management. In other words, parents concerns could have far more advantage than the screening test."
Are common variations in ALG9 associated with bipolar I disorder : a family-based study?,These results suggest that common variations in ALG9 do not play a major role in predisposition to bipolar affective disorder.
Is contingency knowledge necessary for learned motivated behaviour in humans : relevance for addictive behaviour?,"The implication of the present findings is that the control of selective attention, instrumental drug-seeking behaviour and emotional state by drug-paired stimuli is mediated by cognitive knowledge of the predictive contingency between the stimulus and the drug."

Does patient feedback on helpfulness of postal information pack regarding informed consent for endoscopic procedures?,Lack of literacy check and suboptimal subject participation.
Do [ The clinical course of microalbumiuria in 4 burn patients ]?,"The present results show that ACR seems to be correlated with the level of microvascular permeability in 4 burn patients. We conclude that ACR may be a useful indicator to decide the time to administer albumin to a burn patient. However, further investigation is required to decide the threshold value of ACR in a severe burn patient whose ACR are kept above the normal range in the long-term."
Does antiretroviral therapy improve cognitive impairment in HIV+ individuals in sub-Saharan Africa?,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can be associated with improvement in neurocognitive and functional performance in HIV+ individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. These results suggest that HAART, if available in areas with limited resources in sub-Saharan Africa, should be provided for patients with HIV-associated cognitive impairment."
Does eEG and MRI correlate of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer 's disease?,EEG and MRI are each associated with different aspects of cognitive function and complement each other in their relations to psychomotor speed.
Is the growth response to growth hormone ( GH ) treatment in children with isolated GH deficiency independent of the presence of the exon 3-minus isoform of the GH receptor?,Our results indicate that the d3-GHR allele does not affect response to GH treatment or contribute to growth predictions in patients with IGHD who received replacement doses of GH aiming to restore a normal GH status. We did not confirm the previously reported data obtained in patients small for gestational age or with idiopathic short stature who received supraphysiological GH doses.
Is human choline transporter gene variation associated with corticolimbic reactivity and autonomic-cholinergic function?,"CHT1 variation is related to differences in a distributed corticolimbic circuitry mediating behavioral and physiologic arousal. These relations may contribute to a biological mechanism by which genetic variation in cholinergic neurotransmission affects cognition, mood, and autonomic cardiac function."
Does the liquorice effect on the RAAS differ between the genders?,The liquorice-induced inhibition of aldosterone secretion differs between the genders and is not influenced by the BP levels. This difference between the genders has not been exposed before.
Does an angulated common bile duct predispose to recurrent symptomatic bile duct stones after endoscopic stone extraction?,"Angulation of the CBD (< or = 145 degrees) on endoscopic cholangiography, a dilated CBD, and a previous open cholecystectomy are independent risk factors for symptomatic recurrence of bile duct stones. The findings support the role of bile stasis in stone recurrence. Further studies using these data prospectively to identify high-risk patients are warranted."
Does aDAM12-S stimulate bone growth in transgenic mice by modulating chondrocyte proliferation and maturation?,ADAM12-S stimulates bone growth in mice by modulating chondrocyte proliferation and maturation through mechanisms probably involving both metalloprotease and adhesion activities.
Does a command chemical trigger an innate behavior by sequential activation of multiple peptidergic ensembles?,Our findings offer novel insights into how a command chemical orchestrates an innate behavior by stepwise recruitment of central peptidergic ensembles.
Does rapamycin delays but prevent recovery from acute renal failure : role of acquired tubular resistance?,Rapamycin delays but does not prevent renal recovery after ARF. MPT cells become resistant to rapamycin after prolonged exposure. We speculate that the ultimate recovery of renal function after ARF is due to the development of acquired tubular cell resistance to rapamycin.
Does motor enrichment sustain hindlimb movement recovered after spinal cord injury and glial transplantation?,"Transection and transplantation of SC/OEG or OEG induced recovery of hindlimb function. This recovered hindlimb movement was sustained in rats housed in MEH but was progressively lost in rats housed in BH. Because benefits of MEH were not observed until 14 weeks after injury, long-term assessment of behavior is recommended. BH conditions are not conducive to maintenance of recovered hindlimb function, and MEH should be used in studies of recovery of function following spinal cord injury."
Does urinary pentosidine predict cartilage loss among subjects with symptomatic knee OA : the BOKS Study?,"Urinary pentosidine does not predict knee cartilage loss. Previous studies have suggested that local content within cartilage of AGEs is elevated in persons at high risk for progression. Our data suggest that these changes are not measurable systemically. Alternatively, urinary pentosidine levels reflect cartilage degradation in all joints (thus whole body cartilage breakdown) and may therefore not relate to OA severity in a single knee joint."
Is fibrosis in non-cancerous tissue the unique prognostic factor for primary hepatocellular carcinoma without hepatitis B or C viral infection?,Histological assessment of the degree of fibrosis in the non-cancerous regions of NBNC-HCC may be useful not only for the selection of the appropriate treatment but also for the prediction of postoperative prognosis.
Does comparison of symptomatic and asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid plaque feature with in vivo MR imaging?,This study revealed significant differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques in the same patient.
Does ethanol activate cAMP response element-mediated gene expression in select regions of the mouse brain?,these results confirm and extend current concepts that ethanol stimulates cAMP-PKA signaling in brain regions involved in CNS responses to ethanol.
Is low number of examined lymph nodes in node-negative breast cancer patients an adverse prognostic factor?,"Examination of fewer than six lymph nodes is an adverse prognostic factor in NNBC because it could lead to understaging. Six or more nodes need to be examined at axillary dissection to be confident of a node-negative status. This may be useful, in conjunction with other prognostic factors, in the assessment of NNBC patients for adjuvant systemic therapy."
Does dehydroepiandrosterone administration modulate endothelial and neutrophil adhesion molecule expression in vitro?,"Thus, we conclude that one mechanism by which DHEA may exert its protection in animal models is via the differential regulation of adhesion molecule expression."
Does the financial implications of fall in older people for an acute hospital?,Fall-related admissions of olderpeople are a significant financial burden to the health service.
Does low dairy intake in early childhood predict excess body fat gain?,Suboptimal dairy intakes during preschool in this cohort were associated with greater gains in body fat throughout childhood.

Does childhood socioeconomic status predict physical functioning a half century later?,"The social environment in which a child grows up has a strong association with midlife, objectively measured functional status, which is a reflection of the aging process and chronic diseases accumulated over the life course. Of particular interest is the role of higher maternal education in promoting high midlife functioning."
Is efficacy of phototherapy for neonatal jaundice increased by the use of low-cost white reflecting curtains?,Hanging white curtains around phototherapy units significantly increases efficacy of phototherapy in the treatment of neonatal jaundice without evidence of increased adverse effects.
Does a mixture of prebiotic oligosaccharides reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis during the first six months of age?,"Results show for the first time a beneficial effect of prebiotics on the development of atopic dermatitis in a high risk population of infants. Although the mechanism of this effect requires further investigation, it appears likely that oligosaccharides modulate postnatal immune development by altering bowel flora and have a potential role in primary allergy prevention during infancy."
Does expression of mammalian GPCRs in C. elegans generate novel behavioural responses to human ligands?,"Our results illustrate a remarkable evolutionary plasticity in interactions between mammalian GPCRs and C. elegans signalling machinery, spanning 800 million years of evolution. This in vivo system, which imparts novel avoidance behaviour on C. elegans, thus provides a simple means of studying and screening interaction of GPCRs with extracellular agonists, antagonists and intracellular binding partners."
Does the pneumonia severity index predict time to clinical stability in patients with community-acquired pneumonia?,"The PSI is a tool that can be used to predict time to clinical stability (i.e., time to antimicrobial switch therapy) in hospitalized patients with CAP."
Does [ Local applied slow-releasing rapamycin inhibit neointima hyperplasia in vein graft ]?,Local delivery of slow-releasing RPM by F-127 effectively inhibits the neointima hyperplasia in vein graft by a mechanism of reducing the VSMC proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis.
Does atrial fibrillation predict appropriate shocks in primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients?,Our study demonstrates that history of AF is associated with increased risk of appropriate shocks and cardiovascular mortality in primary prevention ICD patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
Is cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients common?,Moderate to severe cognitive impairment is common and undiagnosed in hemodialysis patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether dialysis exacerbates the cognitive impairment attributable to underlying disease. Cognitive testing in hemodialysis patients before dialysis initiation and periodically may be warranted.

Is chronic kidney disease a risk factor for cardiovascular death in a community-based population in Japan : NIPPON DATA90?,CKD was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular death in a community-dwelling Japanese population.
Does iron overload enhance epithelial cell proliferation in endometriotic lesions induced in a murine model?,Iron overload does not appear to affect lesion establishment but may contribute to the further growth of endometriosis by promoting cell proliferation of lesions. Iron chelator treatment could therefore be beneficial in endometriosis to prevent iron overload in the pelvic cavity and decrease cellular proliferation of lesions.
Does previous aneuploidic offspring in a young woman increase the risk for somatic random aneuploidy in subsequent pregnancies?,The known tendency for repeated nondisjunction shown in women with previous aneuploid babies could not be demonstrated in their offsprings.
Is optimal treatment of premature ovarian failure after treatment for Hodgkin 's lymphoma often withheld?,The effect of antitumor treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma on ovarian function is age dependent (odds ratio of 1.18 per year). There is a striking inconsistency regarding the management of ovarian protection before and during antitumor treatment. Premenopausal women who undergo therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma should be offered hormonal substitution therapy after loss of ovarian function.
Is cognitive dysfunction associated with poor diabetes control in older adults?,"Older adults with diabetes have a high risk of undiagnosed cognitive dysfunction, depression, and functional disabilities. Cognitive dysfunction in this population is associated with poor diabetes control."
Do decision-making and technical factors account for the learning curve in complex surgery?,"The main components of the learning curve were considered to be decision-making and technical factors. A mechanism to reduce the surgical learning curve is suggested involving teamwork, and at least two experienced surgeons involved in all major surgical interventions. Decision-making and technical factors account for the learning curve in complex surgery."
Do beta3 integrin and Src facilitate transforming growth factor-beta mediated induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in mammary epithelial cells?,"We show that beta3 integrin alters TGF-beta signaling in MECs via Src-mediated TbetaR-II tyrosine phosphorylation, which significantly enhanced the ability of TGF-beta to induce EMT and invasion. Our findings suggest that beta3 integrin interdiction strategies may represent an innovative approach to re-establishing TGF-beta mediated tumor suppression in progressing human breast cancers."
Does infection with a periodontal pathogen induce procoagulant effects in human aortic endothelial cells?,Taken together these data demonstrate for the first time that infection with a periodontal pathogen induces procoagulant responses in HAEC.
Do early versus delayed enteral nutrition support for burn injuries?,"This systematic review has not found sufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of early versus late enteral nutrition support in adults with burn injury. The trials showed some promising results that would suggest early enteral nutrition support may blunt the hypermetabolic response to thermal injury, but this is insufficient to provide clear guidelines for practice. Further research incorporating larger sample sizes and rigorous methodology that utilises valid and reliable outcome measures, is essential."
Are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase gene expressions significantly correlated in human colorectal cancer?,"In conclusion, our data demonstrated a close relationship between PPARgamma and SSAT in human colorectal cancer and this could represent an attempt to decrease polyamine levels and to reduce cell growth and tumour development. Therefore, pharmacological activation of PPARgamma and/or induction of SSAT may represent a therapeutic or preventive strategy for treating colorectal cancer."
Is surgical and palliative management and outcome in 184 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma : palliative photodynamic therapy plus stenting comparable to r1/r2 resection?,"Only complete tumor resection, including hepatic resection, enables long-term survival for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Palliative PDT and subsequent stenting resulted in longer survival than stenting alone and has a similar survival time compared with incomplete R1 and R2 resection. However, these improvements in palliative treatment by PDT will not change the concept of an aggressive resectional approach."
Does cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta42/phosphorylated tau ratio discriminate between Alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia?,Our results support further efforts to prospectively validate the use of Q Abeta42/p-tau as a biomarker to discriminate between AD and VaD.
Is atMND1 required for homologous pairing during meiosis in Arabidopsis?,"We conclude that AtMND1 is required for homologous pairing and is likely to play a role in the repair of DNA double strand breaks during meiosis in Arabidopsis, thus showing conservation of function with that of MND1 during meiosis in yeast."
Does e-cadherin expression pattern in primary colorectal carcinomas and their metastases reflect disease outcome?,"Examination of E-cadherin expression and distribution in colorectal tumors can be extremely valuable in predicting disease recurrence. The observation that aberrant cytoplasmic expression of E-cadherin can predict disease recurrence is obviously of great importance for both patients and clinicians, and significantly affects decisions concerning the therapy and management of the patients."
Are falls of the elderly associated with burden of caregivers in the community?,"Among the community-dwelling frail elderly, falls are associated with caregiver burden even when controlling for various possible confounding factors."
Does doppler echocardiography markedly underestimate left ventricular stroke work loss in severe aortic valve stenosis?,"In AS, echocardiography gives a biased estimate of LV SWL with marked underestimation in severe disease. Echocardiographic SWL may confuse rather than improve the assessment of AS in clinical practice."
Does downstaging of T or N predict long-term survival after preoperative chemotherapy and radical resection for esophageal carcinoma?,Patients who experience downstaging of T or N after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical surgical resection for esophageal carcinoma have a significantly higher survival rate compared with those who do not experience downstaging. This enhanced survival is comparable to survival rates reported in complete pathologic responders after neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
Is mUC4 a novel prognostic factor of extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma?,MUC4 expression in EHBDC is a new independent factor for poor prognosis and predicts the outcome of patients with EHBDC.
Is combined ultrasound and isotope scanning more informative in the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism than single scanning?,"Isotope scanning was superior to ultrasound in the detection of ectopic tissue. However, ultrasound detected tissue that was not visualised on isotope scanning, and showed abnormalities of thyroid volume and morphology. We would therefore advocate dual scanning in newborns with TSH elevation as each modality provides different information."
Is timing of adequate antibiotic therapy a greater determinant of outcome than are TNF and IL-10 polymorphisms in patients with sepsis?,This study emphasizes that prompt and adequate antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of therapy in sepsis. The three polymorphisms evaluated in the present study appear not to influence the outcome of patients admitted to the hospital with sepsis.
Does co-evolution of transcription factors and their targets depend on mode of regulation?,"We demonstrate that the mode of regulation exerted by transcription factors has a strong effect on their evolution. Repressors co-evolve tightly with their target genes. In contrast, activators can be lost independently of their targets. In fact, loss of an activator can lead to efficient shutdown of an unnecessary pathway."
Do vEGF and angiopoietin-1 stimulate different angiogenic phenotypes that combine to enhance functional neovascularization in adult tissue?,Ang-1 and VEGF use different physiological mechanisms to enhance neovascularization of relatively avascular tissue. Administration of both growth factors combines these physiological mechanisms to give greater enhancement of neovascularization than either growth factor alone. These results suggest that effective revascularization therapy may require combination growth factor treatment.
Does dexmedetomidine decrease emergence agitation in pediatric patients after sevoflurane anesthesia without surgery?,We concluded that a 1 microg x kg(-1) dose of i.v. dexmedetomidine reduces EA after sevoflurane anesthesia in children undergoing MRI.
Is cD105 expression an independent predictor of survival in patients with endometrial cancer?,The current study showed that CD105 is an independent predictor of survival in patients with endometrial cancer. We recommend the use of this highly specific and prognosis-related antigen in further investigations.
Does intracerebral infusion of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor promote striatal neurogenesis after stroke in adult rats?,"Intrastriatal infusion of GDNF in the postischemic period promotes several steps of striatal neurogenesis after stroke, partly through direct action on SVZ progenitors. Because delivery of GDNF has biological effects in the human brain, our data suggest that administration of this factor may promote neuroregenerative responses in stroke patients."
Is expression of WT1 down-regulated in eutopic endometrium obtained during the midsecretory phase from patients with endometriosis?,"During the midsecretory phase, PI in endometrial stromal cells is down-regulated in patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis, and superficial peritoneal endometriosis compared with endometrium from healthy control subjects."
Are maternal testosterone levels during pregnancy associated with offspring size at birth?,"Elevated maternal testosterone levels during human pregnancy are associated with growth restriction in utero. Our results support animal studies, which have indicated that maternal androgen levels influence intrauterine offspring environment and development."

The optical signal may be detected, allowing for improved identification and visualization of tumors, potentially augmenting brain tumor biopsy and resection."
Is time-on-task impairment of psychomotor vigilance affected by mild skin warming and changes with aging and insomnia?,"The results are compatible with the hypothesis that the endogenous circadian variation of skin temperature could modulate vigilance regulating brain areas and thus contribute to the circadian rhythm in vigilance. Minute-by-minute PVT analyses revealed effects of age and insomnia not previously disclosed in studies applying time-point aggregation. Our data indicate that ""age-related cognitive slowing"" may result, in part, from age-related sleep problems."
Are elevated plasma asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine levels linked to endothelial progenitor cell depletion and carotid atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis?,"Plasma asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine levels are elevated in RA patients free of cardiovascular disease or risk factors. Asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine accumulation may contribute to endothelial progenitor cell depletion via depressed NO-dependent endothelial progenitor cell mobilization and/or survival, with consequent impairment of endothelial progenitor cell-mediated endothelial repair, which can promote atherogenesis in RA."
Does multivariate analysis of the Fugl-Meyer outcome measure assessing the effectiveness of GENTLE/S robot-mediated stroke therapy?,"This study has applied a new method for analysing clinical data obtained from rehabilitation robotics studies. While the data obtained during the clinical trial is of multivariate nature, having multipoint and progressive nature, the multiple regression model used showed great potential for drawing conclusions from this study. An important conclusion to draw from this paper is that this study has shown that the intervention and control phase both caused changes over a period of 9 sessions in comparison to the baseline. This might indicate that use of new challenging and motivational therapies can influence the outcome of therapies at a point when clinical changes are not expected. Further work is required to investigate the effects arising from early intervention, longer exposure and intensity of the therapies. Finally, more function-oriented robot-mediated therapies or sling-suspension therapies are needed to clarify the effects resulting from each intervention for stroke recovery."

Do kinetics of NREM delta EEG power density across NREM periods depend on age and on delta-band designation?,"The findings that all normalized ""delta"" electroencephalogram bands in children showed a curvilinear decline across NREMPs that was steeper than that in young adults confirms observations of others and refutes our hypothesis that the decline would be linear with the same slope we found in young adults and elderly. Whether the decline in normalized power in young adults appears linear or curvilinear depends on whether the convex trend of VLF power is included."
Does repeat trigeminal nerve radiosurgery for refractory cluster headache fail to provide long-term pain relief?,"Repeat radiosurgery of the trigeminal nerve fails to provide long-term pain relief for MRCH. Given the reported failures of initial and repeat radiosurgery for MRCH, trigeminal nerve radiosurgery should not be offered for MRCH."
Does prevalence and correlate of disruptive behavior in patients in Norwegian nursing homes?,"Symptoms of agitation were common, but may nevertheless be lower compared to findings in other geographical areas. Further studies are warranted to test this hypothesis, and if confirmed, to explore possible causes for such differences."
Do women have thinner cartilage and smaller joint surfaces than men after adjustment for body height and weight?,"Men have greater knee cABs, ThC and VC than females even after correction for height and weight. Nonetheless, estimated tibial and patellar pressures are similar between sexes and thus are unlikely to account for the sex differences in OA incidence."

Is sequence similarity more relevant than species specificity in probabilistic backtranslation?,"The prediction quality of a protein backtranslation methis markedly increased by replacing the criterion of most used codon in the same species with a Hidden Markov Model trained with a set of most similar sequences from all species. Moreover, the proposed method allows the quality of prediction to be estimated probabilistically."
Are clinical outcomes similar in pulsatile and nonpulsatile left ventricular assist device recipients?,Similarly ill congestive heart failure patients benefited equally well from either a nonpulsatile or a pulsatile LVAD. This may support an expanded role for nonpulsatile LVADs in the treatment of severe heart failure.

Does explicit attention interfere with selective emotion processing in human extrastriate cortex?,"The present findings demonstrate that taxing processing resources by a competing primary visual attention task markedly attenuated the early discrimination of emotional from neutral picture contents. Thus, these results provide further empirical support for an interference account of the emotion-attention interaction under conditions of competition. Previous studies revealed the interference of selective emotion processing when attentional resources were directed to locations of explicitly task-relevant stimuli. The present data suggest that interference of emotion processing by competing task demands is a more general phenomenon extending to the domain of feature-based attention. Furthermore, the results are inconsistent with the notion of effortlessness, i.e., early emotion discrimination despite concurrent task demands. These findings implicate to assess the presumed automatic nature of emotion processing at the level of specific aspects rather than considering automaticity as an all-or-none phenomenon."

Are neurogenesis and helplessness mediated by controllability in males but not in females?,"The modulation of neurogenesis by controllability was evident in males but not in females, as was the expression of helplessness behavior, despite the fact that men are less likely than women to experience depression."
Does leber congenital amaurosis caused by an RPGRIP1 mutation show treatment potential?,"The RPGRIP1-LCA patient has treatment potential for a gene replacement strategy if targeted to central, but not pericentral or peripheral, retina. The results differ from similarly studied RPE65-LCA and CRB1-LCA patients. Preclinical progress toward therapy in LCA patients warrants detailed structure-function studies in humans to determine feasibility and candidacy for clinical trials."
Do patients with irritable bowel syndrome or constipation have an increased risk for ischaemic colitis?,"Patients with irritable bowel syndrome or constipation demonstrated a two- to threefold increased risk for ischaemic colitis. Moreover, irritable bowel syndrome and constipation strongly confounded the relationship between gastrointestinal drug use and the risk for ischaemic colitis, suggesting that etiologic studies of ischaemic colitis risk must account for the presence of irritable bowel syndrome or constipation."

Does cT angiography `` spot sign '' predict hematoma expansion in acute intracerebral hemorrhage?,The computed tomography angiography spot sign is associated with the presence and extent of hematoma progression. Fewer patients achieve a good clinical outcome and hospital stay was longer. Further studies are warranted to validate the ability of this sign to predict clinical outcomes.
Is cyclin D1 guanine/adenine 870 polymorphism with altered protein expression associated with genomic instability and aggressive clinical biology of esophageal adenocarcinoma?,"Our data suggest that CD1 A870 background may be imparting aggressive phenotype to EAC. It provides a molecular basis to explain the clinical biology associated with CD1 polymorphism whereas aberrant nuclear accumulation of CD1 protein enhances the acquisition of genomic instability (ie, clonal diversity), thus leading to early age of EAC diagnosis and poor OS. CD1 genotyping with other biomarkers may help create a biomarker-based prognostic model for EAC and CD1 may also serve as a therapeutic target."
Is breastfeeding 's protection against illness-induced anorexia mediated partially by docosahexaenoic acid?,"Reductions in EI following immunologic or infectious stimuli were associated with increases in IL-1beta and TNFalpha. Those reductions were attenuated by breastfeeding, and mediated in part by tissue DHA."

This may impair deletion of SsAg-activated T cells and resolution of allergic skin inflammation."
Is habitual physical activity associated with intrahepatic fat content in humans?,This study demonstrated that a higher level of habitual physical activity is associated with a lower IHF content and suggested that this relationship may be due to the effect of exercise per se.
Does evaluation of platelet transfusion trigger in a tertiary-care hospital?,The data show that most patients who receive PLTs have pretransfusion counts of more than 10 x 10(9) per L and more than one-third have pretransfusion counts of greater than 20 x 10(9) per L. The medical literature supports prophylactic PLT transfusion based solely on the count when the PLT number is 10 x 10(9) per L or less. Above this level additional justification is needed although there are different points of view concerning the appropriate triggers. Our data suggest that there is a need for clear hospital transfusion guidelines and ongoing monitoring of PLT use.
Do dynamics of hepatitis B e antigen index ratio correlate with treatment response in chronic hepatitis B patients?,"HBeAg index ratio is closely correlated with serum HBV DNA level, and the dynamics of HBeAg index ratio may predict 1-year on-treatment combined response to lamivudine in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients."
Does delayed-enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance identify fibrous tissue in children after surgery for congenital heart disease?,"Delayed-enhancement imaging detects fibrous tissue along regions of reconstruction in patients who have had surgery for congenital heart disease. Furthermore, delayed-enhancement imaging detects fibrous tissue in regions not directly related to the reconstructive surgery, including cardiac valves and the wall of the ascending aorta."
Are serum adiponectin and leptin levels and insulin resistance in children born large for gestational age affected by the degree of overweight?,Prepubertal LGA-born children had a higher mean serum adiponectin levels than matched AGA controls despite the fact that they were more insulin resistant. The degree of excess in utero weight gain appears to influence the metabolic profile in LGA-born prepubertal children. Further studies are needed to delineate the role of adiponectin in the risk of development of insulin resistance in children born LGA.

Is diagnostic electron microscopy still a timely and rewarding method?,"In the history of diagnostic EM in virology, a change in use has been seen. Starting in the 1990s and coincident with the broad introduction of 'modern' diagnostic techniques, the number of EM diagnostic labs has decreased considerably--in spite of the obvious advantages of this technique. To guarantee the continuing performance of diagnostic EM in the future. EQA runs have to be performed as with other techniques in the diagnostic armament. The growing number of participants and participating countries indicates an interest in as well as a need for this program."
Is p300 amplitude related to clinical state in severely and moderately ill patients with schizophrenia?,"Reduced P300 amplitude marks the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but also reflects individual differences in severity, including positive symptoms. Previous failures to find relationships between positive symptoms and P300 may have been due to a restricted range of clinical severity."
Do treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients respond to clozapine after olanzapine non-response?,This study demonstrates that failure to respond to olanzapine treatment does not predict failure to clozapine. Treatment-resistant patients who fail on olanzapine may benefit from a subsequent trial of clozapine.

Does the static rotator cuff affect inferior translation of the humerus at the glenohumeral joint?,The static contribution of the cuff muscles to the inferior stability of the shoulder is insignificant.
Do experience with procedural sedation in a pediatric burn center?,"PS in burn patients allows for early aggressive debridement, decreases the use of the operating room for debridement, and a decrease in length of stay when compared with our previous burn patients. PS has a modest risk of complications, enhances the family's cooperation and satisfaction with health care provided, and should be an integral part of burn care in children."
Do rats show unimpaired learning within minutes after recovery from single bolus propofol anesthesia?,"Training five to seven minutes after recovery from propofol anesthesia resulted in normal retention of the swim- to-platform task. It also produced the same resistance to the disruptive effects of scopolamine as did training in rats that were not anesthetized. Thus, the ability to learn recovers rapidly after propofol anesthesia induced by a single intravenous bolus dose."
Are quantity and origin of transplanted autologous blood cells independent factors associated with speed of postransplant hematological reconstitution?,"The quantity of progenitor cells and transplant type are variables significantly associated with the speed of postransplant engraftment, but these two parameters are mutually independent. The number of stem cells estimated by CFU-GM assay is a good and reliable routine test for predicting hematopoietic recovery."

They also suggest that on day 7 of detoxification, alcoholic subjects with multiple previous detoxifications have decreased visual cortex, medial temporal lobes, and anterior paralimbic blood flow, compared with those in their first detoxification. Further studies seem warranted to confirm these initial exploratory results."
Does childhood maltreatment increase risk for personality disorders during early adulthood?,Persons in the community who have experienced childhood abuse or neglect are considerably more likely than those who were not abused or neglected to have PDs and elevated PD symptom levels during early adulthood. Childhood abuse and neglect may contribute to the onset of some PDs.
Does intermittent perfusion protect the brain during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest?,"Intermittent perfusion during DHCA is clinically practical and results in normal cerebral metabolic and ultrastructural recovery. Furthermore, the correlation between brain structure and CMRO2 suggests that monitoring CMRO2 during the operation may be an outstanding way to investigate new strategies for neuroprotection designed to reduce cerebral damage in children undergoing correction of congenital cardiac defects."
Do diet fat and oral insulin-like growth factor influence the membrane fatty acid composition of suckling rat small intestine?,"The changes observed in C20:4n-6 levels in response to oral insulin-like growth factor-1, combined with the apparent trend of increased lactase activity with declining levels of C20:4n-6, may be of significance in the development of the small intestine in early life."
Is manganese absorption and retention by young women associated with serum ferritin concentration?,"These results show that iron status, as measured by serum ferritin concentration, is strongly associated with the amount of manganese absorbed from a meal by young women. When greater amounts of manganese are absorbed, the body may compensate by excreting manganese more quickly."
Does chronic subthalamic nucleus stimulation reduce medication requirements in Parkinson 's disease?,"Parkinsonian signs can be controlled by bilateral high-frequency STN stimulation. The procedure is well tolerated. On-state dyskinesias were greatly reduced, probably due to the reduction of total antiparkinsonian medication. Bilateral high-frequency STN stimulation compensated for drug reduction and elicited dyskinesias, which differ from those observed following dopaminergic medication. ADL improved significantly, suggesting that some motor tasks performed during everyday chores, and that are not taken into account in the UPDRS motor score, also improved."
Is nitric oxide production in meningococcal disease directly related to disease severity?,Higher levels of nitrates and nitrites are seen in sicker children with meningococcal disease.
Does prolonged low-dose infusion of human parathyroid hormone increase femoral cancellous bone volume in ovariectomized rats?,These results support the absolute requirement of daily injections for the osteogenic action of hPTH on bone.

"Are impaired mobility , ASA status and administration of tramadol risk factors for postoperative delirium in patients aged 75 years or more after major abdominal surgery?","PD is a frequent and severe postoperative event in elderly patients after major abdominal surgery. A perioperative geriatric assessment should be recommended to patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists status of 3-4 and preoperative impaired mobility to facilitate the management of PD. In these patients, the postoperative administration of tramadol should be avoided."
Does metabolomic analyses of plasma reveal new insights into asphyxia and resuscitation in pigs?,"This study provides a novel strategy and set of biomarkers. It provides biochemical in vivo data that resuscitation with 100% oxygen delays cellular recovery. In addition, the oxysterol increase raises concerns about the safety of 100% O(2) resuscitation. Our biomarkers can be used in a broad clinical setting for evaluation or the prediction of damage in conditions associated with low tissue oxygenation in both infancy and adulthood. These findings have to be validated in human trials."
Is elevated brain natriuretic peptide associated with abnormal heart geometry in children with chronic kidney disease?,BNP might predict an abnormal geometry in children with CKD.
Is the reproductive outcome of female patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 ( DM1 ) undergoing PGD affected by the size of the expanded CTG repeat tract?,There is no evidence of an effect of trinucleotide repeat length on reproductive outcome in patients undergoing ICSI and PGD.
Does bispectral index correlate well with Richmond agitation sedation scale in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients?,Our results illustrate that BIS correlates well with RASS when assessing the level of sedation in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. BIS reliably differentiates inadequate from adequate sedation.
Do depressive symptoms predict incident cognitive impairment in cognitive healthy older women?,"These data suggest that depression may be the risk factors for cognitive decline, and thus a potential target for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions."
Is catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia caused by mutation-linked defective conformational regulation of the ryanodine receptor?,"A single point mutation within the RyR2 sensitizes the channel to agonists and reduces the threshold of luminal [Ca(2+)] for activation, primarily mediated by defective interdomain interaction within the RyR2."
Do normoglycemic plasma glucose levels affect F-18 FDG uptake in the brain?,"Our results indicated that plasma glucose levels that are within the normoglycemic range have a small but systematic effect on F-18 FDG uptake in the brain (following an inverse relationship). Normalizing plasma glucose levels to a standard glucose concentration successfully reduced the intra-subject variability of SUV measures. Inter-subject variability, however, remained high suggesting that other factors have an influence as well."
Are left atrial phasic volumes modulated by the type rather than the extent of left ventricular hypertrophy?,"Patients with HCM appeared to have larger LA volumes, poorer LA function, and greater severity of diastolic dysfunction compared with those with HT having comparable LV mass. LA changes may be due to coexistent atrial myopathy associated with other pathophysiologic aspects of HCM, including outflow obstruction, mitral regurgitation, and myocardial fibrosis in HCM."
Is in vitro evaluation of novel antisense oligonucleotides predictive of in vivo exon skipping activity for Duchenne muscular dystrophy?,In vitro screening of different AOs within the same chemical class is a reliable method for predicting the in vivo exon skipping efficiency of AOs for DMD.
Does abscisic acid ameliorate experimental IBD by downregulating cellular adhesion molecule expression and suppressing immune cell infiltration?,We conclude that ABA ameliorates gut inflammation by modulating T cell distribution and adhesion molecule expression.
Are hEPACAM1 and 2 differentially regulated in canine mammary adenomas and carcinomas and its lymph node metastases?,"HEPACAM1 and 2 seem to be important for cell-cell adhesion of normal and neoplastic canine mammary cells. The loss of HEPACAM1 protein expression in adenomas but not in carcinomas questions its role as a tumour suppressor at late stages of malignant transformation and indicates that it might rather be involved in physiologic mammary cell adhesion and canine mammary tumour metastasis. Furthermore, it can be speculated, whether HEPACAM2 plays a different role in malignancy and metastasis of canine mammary tumours since its transcriptional levels are different in carcinomas and their lymph node metastases when compared to HEPACAM1."
Does initial experience of heroin use under a two-chained operant schedule influence drug-seeking behavior after one month of abstinence?,These observations suggest that an early experience of drug use is sufficient to maintain heroin-seeking behavior even after a one month abstinence.
Is metabolic crisis after traumatic brain injury associated with a novel microdialysis proteome?,Metabolic distress after TBI is associated with a differential proteome that indicates cellular destruction during the acute phase of illness. This suggests that metabolic distress has immediate cellular consequences after TBI.
Does inhibition of Aurora Kinase A enhance chemosensitivity of medulloblastoma cell lines?,"These data indicate that inhibition of Aurora Kinase A inhibits cell growth in medulloblastoma through inhibition of pro-proliferative signaling pathways Wnt, Myc, and RB. Additionally, combining Aurora Kinase A inhibition with other chemotherapeutic agents significantly lowers their IC(50), which make it a promising small molecule target for medulloblastoma therapy."
Are three-year changes in fitness and adiposity independently associated with cardiovascular risk factors among young Danish children?,Change in fitness and adiposity were independently associated with the development of cardiovascular risk factors among young children suggesting a need to increase CRF and prevent weight gain early during development to improve cardiovascular health.
Is vEGF-A165b cytoprotective and antiangiogenic in the retina?,The survival effects of VEGF-A(165)b signaling can protect the retina from ischemic damage. These results suggest that VEGF-A(165)b may be a useful therapeutic agent in ischemia-induced angiogenesis and a cytoprotective agent for retinal pigment epithelial cells.
Is enrollment in physical education associated with health-related behavior among high school students?,Findings suggest that higher levels of enrollment in PE classes could play a role in the promotion of health-related behaviors among high school students.
Do two additive mechanisms impair the differentiation of 'substrate-selective ' p38 inhibitors from classical p38 inhibitors in vitro?,"Our integrated mechanistic modeling and experimental validation provides an example of how systems biology approaches can be applied to drug discovery and provide a basis for decision-making with limited chemical matter. We find that, given our current understanding, it is unlikely that 'substrate-selective' inhibitors of p38 will work as originally intended when placed in the context of more complex cellular environments, largely due to a stoichiometric excess of MK2 relative to p38."
Is a novel thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin bioassay a functional indicator of activity and severity of Graves ' orbitopathy?,The novel Mc4/TSI is a functional indicator of GO activity and severity.
Does optical spectroscopy of the breast in premenopausal women reveal tissue variation with changes in age and parity?,"Optical spectroscopy may be useful to identify breast tissue at increased risk of cancer development and track changes over time, particularly in young women where exposure to radiation is of particular concern. Additional work is needed to confirm the observed breast tissue differences and to determine the specific tissue chromophore changes with age and parity."
Does docosahexaenoic acid withstand the Aβ ( 25-35 ) -induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells?,DHA not only inhibits the in vitro fibrillation but also resists the Aβ(25-35)-induced toxicity in the neuronal cells. This might be the basis of the DHA-induced amelioration of Aβ-induced neurodegeneration and related cognitive deficits.
Do transcriptional profiles predict disease outcome in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?,"This work suggests that it may be possible to stratify CTCL patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups based on gene expression."
Does cheating explain selective differences at high and low relatedness in a social amoeba?,These results suggest that social competition and something beyond solitary growth differences occurs during the vegetative stage when amoebae eat bacteria and divide by binary fission. The high degree of repeatability of our results indicates that these effects are strong and points to the importance of new approaches to studying interactions in D. discoideum.
Is mDM2 SNP309 genotype associated with ferritin and LDH serum levels in children with stage 4 neuroblastoma?,The association between MDM2 SNP309 and both ferritin and LDH in patients with stage 4 disease confirms the prognostic role of this polymorphism. The results suggest that the MDM2 SNP309 genotype can impact on tumour responses to hypoxia and might play an important role in the alteration of energetic metabolism in NB cells.
"Is low mRNA expression of the apoptosis-related genes CASP3 , CASP8 , and FAS associated with low induction treatment response in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )?",These findings suggest an association between lower expression levels of the pro-apoptotic genes and a poor response to induction therapy at day 7 and prognosis in childhood ALL.
Does physical activity attenuate intermittent hypoxia-induced spatial learning deficits and oxidative stress?,"Behavioral modifications such as increased physical activity are associated with decreased susceptibility to IH-induced spatial task deficits and lead to reduced oxidative stress, possibly through improved preservation of insulin growth factor-1-Akt neuronal signaling. Considering the many advantages of PA, interventional strategies targeting behavioral modifications leading to increased PA should be pursued in patients with sleep-disordered breathing."
Does pre-operative ultrasound with a 12-15 MHz linear probe reliably differentiate between melanoma thicker and thinner than 1 mm?,Ultrasound examination with a 12-15 MHz linear transducer can reliably differentiate primary melanoma > 1 mm from those <or= 1 mm.
Is nPC1L1 inhibitor ezetimibe a reliable therapeutic agent for non-obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease?,We conclude that the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe can suppress hepatic injury in non-obese patients with NAFLD and that ezetimibe may offer a novel treatment for NAFLD.
Is brownian diffusion of AMPA receptors sufficient to explain fast onset of LTP?,Fast accumulation of AMPA Receptors is consistent with experimentally observed fast onset of LTP expression.
Are susceptibility loci reported in genome-wide association studies associated with Crohn 's disease in Canadian children?,The identified susceptibility genes/loci for adult-onset CD also confer risk for paediatric-onset CD.
Do sleep and circadian rhythm alterations correlate with depression and cognitive impairment in Huntington 's disease?,"HD is primarily accompanied by night-time sleep disturbances and a delayed sleep phase, which are associated with depression and lower cognitive as well as functional performance."
Does ileal interposition surgery improve glucose and lipid metabolism and delays diabetes onset in the UCD-T2DM rat?,"IT surgery delays the onset of diabetes in UCD-T2DM rats which may be related to increased nutrient-stimulated secretion of GLP-1(7-36) and PYY and improvements of insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and lipid metabolism."
Do human mammary epithelial cells exhibit a bimodal correlated random walk pattern?,"Because of the presence of non-uniform turn angle distribution of move step-lengths within a flight and two different types of flights, we propose that the epithelial random walk is a BCRW comprising of two alternating modes with varying degree of correlations, rather than a simple persistent random walk. A BCRW model rather than a simple persistent random walk correctly matches the super-diffusivity in the cell migration paths as indicated by simulations based on the BCRW model."
Does sputum induction with hypertonic saline reduce fractional exhaled nitric oxide in chronic smokers and non-smokers?,"Our data extend previous findings in asthmatics and healthy controls to asymptomatic chronic smokers: 1. FeNO measurements are reproducible in both smokers and non-smokers; 2. baseline FeNO levels in chronic smokers are lower than in non-smokers and 3. sputum induction by hypertonic saline reduces FeNO levels in both study groups, without affecting lung function."
Do adrenomedullin plasma levels predict left ventricular reverse remodeling after cardiac resynchronization therapy?,Significantly higher ADM levels indicate a subgroup of patients in whom reverse remodeling can be observed after CRT. Patients with lower ADM basal values before CRT could represent a group in whom the dysfunction is so advanced that no improvement can be expected.
Are neurogenic effects of fluoxetine attenuated in p11 ( S100A10 ) knockout mice?,P11 is abundantly expressed in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. The p11 KO mice have increased levels of markers for immature neuronal cell survival and neurogenesis and an attenuated response to fluoxetine in measures of neurogenesis and in a neurogenesis-dependent behavioral test.
Are nailfold capillary abnormalities prevalent in sclerodermoid graft-versus-host disease and readily detected with dermatoscopy?,This study shows the identification of distinct nailfold capillaroscopy patterns in patients with Scl GVHD but it does not confer special risk for any other specific clinical symptoms of the disease.
Is on-treatment serum HBsAg level predictive of sustained off-treatment virologic response to telbivudine in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients?,Serum HBsAg levels <2 log(10)IU/ml at treatment week 104 are highly predictive of SR to telbivudine at 2 years off-treatment. HBsAg decline rate at on-treatment weeks 24 and 52 from baseline were also more predictive of SR than HBV DNA decline rate.
Is cumulus cell gene expression associated with oocyte developmental quality and influenced by patient and treatment characteristics?,"The expression of ovulation related genes in CC is associated with patient and treatment characteristics, oocyte developmental potential and differs with the type of gonadotrophin used."
Is qRS duration associated with atrial fibrillation in patients with left ventricular dysfunction?,"In this large cohort of patients, QRSd was strongly associated with AF and therefore may predict the occurrence of this arrhythmia in patients with LV dysfunction. This association persisted after adjusting for disease severity, comorbid conditions, and the use of medications known to be protective against AF."
Is caudate atrophy on MRI a characteristic feature of FTLD-FUS?,"Caudate atrophy on MRI appears to be significantly greater in FTLD-FUS compared with FTLD-TDP and FTLD-TAU, suggesting that severe caudate atrophy may be a useful clinical feature to predict FTLD-FUS pathology."
Do knowledge and quality of life in female torture survivors?,Little is currently known about health-based interventions for the vulnerable population of female torture survivors. Public health nurses and other professionals who work with this population have a unique opportunity to influence behavior change and promote empowerment in this population. The techniques employed in this study can be used by public health nurses as a basis for designing women's health-based programmes at other torture treatment centres throughout the world.
Does informed consent document improvement increase patients ' comprehension in biomedical research?,We failed to show that improving IC document comprehension through a lexicosyntactic approach or by a working group leads to better comprehension.
Do genetic and environmental influences on internalizing psychopathology vary as a function of economic status?,"Findings support social causation by suggesting that low income contributes significantly to environmental variation in INT. Modest support was found for social selection, but should be extended using longitudinal designs. Effective interventions for internalizing psychopathology may differ depending on income."
Do basal core promoters control the equilibrium between negative cofactor 2 and preinitiation complexes in human cells?,TFIIB and NC2 are global players that occupy active genes. Preinitiation complex formation is independent of core elements at the majority of genes. TATA and TATA-like elements dictate TFIIB occupancy at a subset of genes. Biochemical data support a model in which preinitiation complex but not TBP-NC2 complex formation is regulated.
Do winter active bumblebees ( Bombus terrestris ) achieve high foraging rates in urban Britain?,"B. terrestris in the UK are now able to utilise a rich winter foraging resource in urban parks and gardens that might at present still be under-exploited, opening up the possibility of further changes in pollinator phenology."
"Are there no clearly superior methods for diagnosing , predicting , and noninvasively treating dental caries?","(1) Past caries is the best predictor of future caries. (2) A combination of visual-tactile and radiographic examination is better than either method alone. (3) There is insufficient evidence to support noninvasive treatment of early caries. STUDY OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To perform a systematic review of published literature to (1) determine the evidence for the effectiveness of different methods (visual-tactile versus radiographic) for detecting caries; (2) identify the most prescient predictors of dental caries; and (3) evaluate the evidence supporting the use of noninvasive methods for the treatment of caries, particularly early caries."
Do high-frequency electroencephalographic oscillations correlate with outcome of epilepsy surgery?,"The correlation between removal of HFO-generating areas and good surgical outcome indicates that HFOs could be used as a marker of epileptogenicity and may be more accurate than spike-generating areas or the SOZ. In patients in whom the majority of HFO-generating tissue remained, a poor surgical outcome occurred."
"Is maternal anxiety related to infant neurological condition , paternal anxiety is not?",Infants of mothers with high trait anxiety have an increased vulnerability to develop a non-optimal nervous system. The association may be mediated in part by early programming of monoaminergic systems. Future research should include an exploration of specific windows of vulnerability to maternal anxiety.
Is intranasal naloxone delivery an alternative to intravenous naloxone for opioid overdoses?,"Intranasal naloxone is statistically as effective as IV naloxone at reversing the effects of opioid overdose. The IV and IN groups had similar average increases in RR and GCS. Based on our results, IN naloxone is a viable alternative to IV naloxone while posing less risk of needle stick injury. Additionally, we demonstrated that GCS is correlated with RR in opioid intoxication."
Do three-dimensional vessel analyses provide more accurate length estimations than the gold standard QCA?,Three-dimensional QCA provides accurate and precise vessel diameter assessments. Length assessments are consistently longer than two-dimensional measures and are significantly less affected by foreshortened projections.
Does b-type natriuretic peptide predict responses to indomethacin in premature neonates with patent ductus arteriosus?,High baseline BNP levels predict poor responses to indomethacin and the need for surgery in premature neonates with PDA.
Is infant overweight associated with delayed motor development?,Pediatric overweight and high subcutaneous fat are associated with delayed infant motor development.
"Is pTCH1 , a receptor of Hedgehog signaling pathway , correlated with metastatic potential of colorectal cancer?",Our data suggest that PTCH1 might be a potential biomarker that could discriminate CRC with high from that with low metastatic risk.
Do variants of the Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 but not the Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 genes significantly influence functional outcome after stroke?,The results presented strongly indicate that MMP-2 genetic variants are an important mediator of functional outcome after stroke.
Is surveillance colonoscopy cost-effective for patients with adenomas who are at high risk of colorectal cancer?,Surveillance colonoscopy is cost-effective for patients who are at high risk for developing colorectal cancer. Aggressive surveillance can be expensive or even harmful; efforts should be made to improve risk models for colonic neoplasia.
Are war-related stressors associated with asthma risk among older Kuwaitis following the 1990 Iraqi invasion and occupation?,"War-related trauma is associated with increased asthma risk in these elderly civilians. Although prior research has documented the significant and persistent psychological toll of war, these findings implicate even broader health effects."
Are postpartum bipolar episodes distinct from spontaneous episodes : implications for DSM-V?,"The present study does not take account of potential factors that may influence the outcome of a postpartum episode, including obstetric complications and social support before delivery. Similarly, dimensional and qualitative aspects of bipolar disorder were not included in our analysis."
Are variations in FKBP5 and BDNF genes suggestively associated with depression in a Swedish population-based cohort?,The sample size did not allow exclusion of true association to depression at low odds ratios. There was possibly some recall bias of childhood problems.
Does low dose dobutamine stress echocardiography predict the improvement of left ventricular systolic function in dilated cardiomyopathy?,Changes in left ventricular systolic performance during low dose dobutamine stress echocardiography are a useful marker to predict the outcome of left ventricular systolic function in patients with DCM.
Are advance directives more likely among seniors asked about end-of-life care preferences?,Clinicians can play an important role in increasing AD completion rates among seniors by bringing up the subject of EOLCPs.
Do postmenopausal women without previous or current vasomotor symptoms flush after abruptly abandoning estrogen replacement therapy?,"Postmenopausal women without previous or current vasomotor symptoms did not develop such symptoms when estrogen replacement therapy was first instituted and then abruptly stopped. Probably other factors than the rate with which estrogen concentrations decrease determine whether or not a woman will develop vasomotor symptoms. Evidently, estrogens can be prescribed to a woman who has no vasomotor symptoms, without much risk of inducing such symptoms if she decides to abandon therapy, even after 3 months of treatment."
Do higher-quality human sperm in a sample selectively attach to oviduct ( fallopian tube ) epithelial cells in vitro?,Selective attachment of functionally superior sperm to OEC is likely important during sperm reservoir formation in vivo and may be exploitable in vitro as a method to isolate high-quality sperm for clinical procedures. Such a system does not require human origin OEC.
Does biochemical but not clinical vitamin A deficiency result from mutations in the gene for retinol binding protein?,"We conclude that the cellular supply of vitamin A to target tissues might be bypassed in these siblings via circulating retinyl esters, beta-carotene, or retinoic acid, thereby maintaining the health of peripheral tissues."
Does quantitative proton MRS predict outcome after traumatic brain injury?,"1H-MRS provides a rapid, noninvasive tool to assess the extent of diffuse injury after head trauma, a component of injury that may be the most critical factor in evaluating resultant neuropsychological dysfunction. 1H-MRS can be added to conventional MR examinations with minimal additional time, and may prove useful in assessing injury severity, guiding patient care, and predicting patient outcome."
Does high prevalence of the Cys282Tyr HFE mutation facilitate an improved diagnostic service for hereditary haemochromatosis in South Africa?,"The detection of mutations C282Y and H63D at a high frequency in the majority of affected South African patients facilitates accurate pre-clinical and confirmatory diagnosis of HH in South Africa. Early detection by DNA screening and subsequent treatment by repeated phlebotomy can prevent disease onset in affected individuals. DNA diagnosis is particularly applicable to a common genetic disease such as HH, which is underdiagnosed and potentially lethal, but treatable."
Do magnetic resonance imaging techniques demonstrate soft tissue damage in the diabetic foot?,Changes in MT activity reflect qualitative structural changes which this study reveals are extensive in the diabetic neuropathic foot. Fibrotic atrophy of the plantar fat pad may affect its ability to dissipate the increased weight-bearing forces associated with diabetic neuropathy.
Do a simple test of copying ability and sex define survival in patients with early Alzheimer 's disease?,"A simple test of copying ability defines subgroups of AD patients with large differences in survival rates. This suggests that parietal lobe impairment is an important predictor of mortality in AD. Also, the course of AD may be more benign in women than in men."
Are thyroid vascularity and blood flow dependent on serum thyroid hormone levels : studies in vivo by color flow doppler sonography?,An increase in both intrathyroidal vascularity and blood velocity was observed in patients with spontaneous hyperthyroidism but not in thyrotoxicosis due to either ingestion of thyroid hormones or to a thyroidal destructive process. The slightly increased vascularity and blood velocity observed in patients with hypothyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis suggests that thyroid stimulation by either TSH-receptor antibody or TSH is responsible for the increased thyroid blood flow.
Are mutations in JAGGED1 gene predominantly sporadic in Alagille syndrome?,"Most of the observed mutations other than the missense mutations in JAGGED1 are expected to give rise to truncated and unanchored proteins. All mutations mapped to the extracellular domain of the protein, and there appeared to be regional hot spots, although no clustering was observed. Thus, the sequencing of 7 exons of JAGGED1 would detect 51% of the mutations. Transmission analysis showed a high frequency of sporadic cases (70%)."
Is bcl-2 protein expression associated with a prognostically favourable phenotype in breast cancer irrespective of p53 immunostaining?,"In breast cancer, bcl-2 protein is associated with a prognostically favourable phenotype and appears to be related to hormonal regulation, rather than to disabled p53 gene function."
Does comparative genomic hybridization reveal DNA copy number gains to frequently occur in human prostate cancer?,"Amplification events at different chromosomal sites seem important in prostate cancer development. A new chromosome region with DNA copy number gains was identified on 12q, while other regions on 3q, 7q, 8q, and Xq were confirmed or narrowed down, indicating a possible role of known or putative protooncogenes in these regions for prostate cancer growth. Our low detection rate of DNA losses may to some part be explained by CGH immanent technical limitations."
Are glucocorticoid receptors down-regulated in inflamed colonic mucosa but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with inflammatory bowel disease?,"In IBD there is no difference in systemic hGR levels between not steroid-treated patients and control subjects, in spite of inflammatory activity (IL-6). Mucosal hGR levels were decreased independently of treatment, probably leading to a decreased protection against NF-kappaB action in the intestinal mucosa."
Does elevated cardiac troponin I predict a high-risk angiographic anatomy of the culprit lesion in unstable angina?,"In patients with unstable angina and angiographically proven coronary artery disease, increased cTnI within 24 hours of admission but not increased CRP is associated with an angiographic appearance of the culprit lesion carrying a high risk of complication, especially in the event of angioplasty."
Does immunoreconstitution after ritonavir therapy in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection involve multiple lymphocyte lineages?,"Early increases in lymphocytes after ritonavir therapy are a result of recirculation, as shown by increases in B cells and CD4(+) CD45RO and CD8(+) T cells. Children exhibited a high potential to reconstitute CD4(+) CD45RA T cells even with advanced disease and incomplete viral suppression."
Do a method to evaluate microcirculatory vascular patency of full thickness burn in an animal model?,"Muscle layer, where just below the burn area and tightly attached to the skin, could be assessed as a representative of the extension of the injury."
Does apolipoprotein E deficiency worsen outcome from global cerebral ischemia in the mouse?,ApoE deficiency worsens ischemic outcome. This is not attributable to effects on CBF. A role of apoE in the cerebral response to global ischemia is consistent with prior reports that murine apoE deficiency increases infarct size resulting from focal cerebral ischemia.
Is accurate lymph-node detection in colorectal specimens resected for cancer of prognostic significance?,"This study demonstrates the prognostic impact of specimen examination. Inaccurate methods could down-stage the tumor and exclude the patient from adjuvant therapies, with detrimental effects on the outcome of the case."
Do molecular fingerprinting of mupirocin-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from a burn unit?,"Results of typing the mupirocin-resistant MRSA from the burn unit with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated that closely related MRSA clones previously circulating in the unit had acquired a high-level mupirocin-resistant plasmid, and spread aided by mupirocin use."
Do additional investigations fail to alter the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome in subjects fulfilling the Rome criteria?,"Examination of screening tests in 1452 patients with an established history of IBS revealed an incidence of lactose malabsorption comparable to that in the general U.S. population and a low incidence of thyroid dysfunction, ova and parasite infestation, or colonic pathology. The limited detection rates, added costs, and inconvenience of these tests suggest that their routine use in the diagnostic evaluation of established IBS patients should be scrutinized."
Do vitamin D receptor alleles predict growth and bone density in girls?,"In prepubertal girls, VDR alleles contribute to lumbar spine volumetric BMD variance, but the areal BMD effect reflects the relation between areal BMD and growth. VDR alleles might affect postnatal growth regulation."
Is outcome of kidney transplantation from high-risk donors determined by both structure and function?,Calculated donor CrCl and donor vascular pathology predict recipient graft function and may be helpful in selecting high-risk donors for single kidney transplantation.
Does absent middle cerebral artery flow predict the presence and evolution of the ischemic penumbra?,"Absent MCA flow on MRA predicts the presence of a presumed penumbral pattern on acute PI and DWI and worse stroke outcome. Combined MRA, PI, and DWI can identify individual patients at risk of ischemic core progression and the potential to respond to thrombolytic therapy beyond 3 hours."
Is from the lab to the clinic : activation of an alpha-2 agonist pathway neuroprotective in models of retinal and optic nerve injury?,Treatment with the alpha 2 adrenoreceptor agonist brimonidine was found to confer neuroprotection to retinal ganglion cells in two distinct models of neuronal injury resulting from acute retinal ischemia/reperfusion and calibrated optic nerve compression.
Is sialyl Tn antigen expression associated with the prognosis of patients with advanced colorectal cancer?,We conclude that not only lymph node metastasis but also STN expression are important prognostic factors in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma who undergo curative surgical resection.
Does e-cadherin expression correlate with tumor differentiation in colorectal cancer?,Abnormal E-cadherin expression in colorectal cancer correlates with loss of differentiation.
Are mice deficient in inducible nitric oxide synthase susceptible to experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis?,"A functional iNOS gene is not necessary for EAU pathogenesis. Therefore, upregulation of NO is not required to mediate autoimmune tissue damage in the eye."
Is chronic stress associated with spousal caregiving of patients with Alzheimer 's dementia associated with downregulation of B-lymphocyte GH mRNA?,"Because the B-cell population is the source of antibody production, our findings suggest that the decrease in B-cell GH mRNA may contribute to the poor immune response to influenza virus vaccination that has been reported previously in chronically stressed caregivers."
Does [ Quantification of functional retinal damage in branch retinal vein thrombose ]?,"BRVO may lead to significant reductions of central and paracentral retinal function. Angiographically observed leakage is not always directly correlated to the magnitude of retinal sensitivity loss. As spontenous remission is frequent in one group and intact retinal function can be shown in areas of angiographic leakage, therapeutic interventions, e.g., laser treatment, should be carefully considered. Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy provides additional information for precise evaluation and follow-up of the retinal damage in BRVO."
Is increased aortic stiffness in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus associated with diabetes duration and autonomic nerve function?,"Increased aortic wall stiffness found in women with Type 1 DM is related to diabetes duration. Further, in women with Type 1 DM there is a correlation between increased aortic stiffness and parasympathetic dysfunction. This may be of importance for the increased susceptibility to cardiovascular complications in diabetic women."
Are symptoms of depression important to psychological adaptation and metabolic control in children with diabetes mellitus?,"The major conclusion is that symptoms of depression affect both adaptation and metabolic control. It should be of concern to identify patients with depressive symptoms, offer treatment for their emotional difficulties and increase the support for taking care of their diabetes."
Is [ Antral biopsy sufficient to confirm Helicobacter pylori eradication with the `` new '' one-week long triple treatments ]?,"Taking antral biopsies is enough for confirming H. pylori eradication with the ""new"" one week triple therapies."
Are elevated levels of serum carbohydrate deficient transferrin specific for alcohol abuse in patients with liver disease?,"Thus, in a patient with a negative interview for chronic alcohol abuse and normal carbohydrate deficient transferrin level, alcohol is unlikely to be the cause of liver disease, and further investigations to establish the etiology of liver disease are warranted. An increased carbohydrate deficient transferrin level, however, cannot be regarded as reliable evidence for chronic alcohol abuse in patients with liver disease."
Do a clinical report on speech production of cochlear implant users?,"Despite being deprived of acoustic speech information for many childhood years, roughly half of the patients assessed showed significant gains in speech intelligibility and articulation postimplantation. The lack of a control group of non-implanted patients means that we cannot separate out the influence of the implant on speech production from other influences such as training and tactile-kinaesthetic feedback."
Are activation and repolarization patterns governed by different structural characteristics of ventricular myocardium : experimental study with voltage-sensitive dyes and numerical simulations?,"In experiments and simulations, the helical rotation of epicardial excitation isochrones caused by pacing at increasing depth in the myocardium correlated with the helical three-dimensional architecture of ventricular fibers. In contrast, repolarization was independent of the activation sequence and was mainly guided by spatial differences in APDs between apex and base."
Is parenteral nutrition associated with intestinal morphologic and functional changes in humans?,"Intestinal morphologic and functional changes occur in human for whom TPN is the sole nutritional source, although the findings in humans are substantially less significant than observed in animal models. The loss of mucosal structure may be sufficient to cause increased intestinal permeability, the clinical significance of which remains to be defined. Enteral nutrition is important in restoring and probably preventing morphologic intestinal changes associated with TPN, and a peptide and free amino acid-based formula supplemented with glutamine and arginine may have some added role. Our findings also suggest sepsis is associated with gut adaptation rather than degradation."
Does anterior resection control cancer of the rectum as well as abdominoperineal excision?,"The significantly increased number of anterior resections compared with AP excisions of the rectumin did not compromise our results in terms of local recurrence and five year survival, but did reduce the number of permanent colostomies."
Does apolipoprotein E genotype influence rates of cognitive decline in Alzheimer 's disease?,These results indicate that the mechanism placing individuals with an epsilon 4 allele at risk for developing AD does not influence the rate of cognitive decline. These observations imply that the influence of apoE epsilon 4 either precedes or occurs at an early point in the AD disease process.
Does [ used of endoscopic video-camera in open surgery ]?,We believe that using the endoscopic camera in open surgery is a low-cost alternative to the more sophisticated video camera systems.
Do optimization of a breath-hold magnetic resonance gradient echo technique for the detection of interstitial lung disease?,"Using standard magnetic resonance software and hardware, it has been possible to use a breath-hold sequence that allows detection and quantification of interstitial lung disease."
Is a family history of NIDDM associated with decreased aortic distensibility in normal healthy young adult subjects?,A positive family history of NIDDM is associated with decreased aortic distensibility in early adult life. The relevance of these observations to future cardiovascular events merits further investigation.
Are endoluminal ultrasound and low-field magnetic resonance imaging superior to clinical examination in the preoperative staging of rectal cancer?,"These findings indicate that MRI seems to underestimate the extension of rectal tumours, but both ELU and MRI can be helpful in selecting patients with advanced tumours for whom preoperative adjuvant treatment is being considered. ELU is superior in staging tumours confined to the rectal wall, and could be of value in the selection of patients whose tumours were suitable for local excision. None of these techniques, however, can reliably identify the extent of lymph node involvement."
Are peritoneal endometriosis and `` endometriotic '' nodules of the rectovaginal septum two different entities?,It is suggested that the rectovaginal endometriotic nodule is a different disease from peritoneal endometriosis and must be called rectovaginal adenomyosis or rectovaginal adenomyoma. Its histopathogenesis probably is not related to the implantation of regurgitated endometrial cells but to the metaplasia of Müllerian rests.
Is the immunological pregnancy protective effect of progesterone manifested via controlling cytokine production?,"Our data allow the assumption that via blocking IL-12 production PIBF inhibits NK activation with a concomitant reduction of TNF alpha levels. Disturbances in this system might lead to the expression of the known synergistic effect of IL-12 and TNF alpha, resulting in a Th 1 type cytokine dominance and pregnancy termination."
Does melatonin prevent ischemia reperfusion injury in hamster cheek pouch microcirculation?,The beneficial effect of ME may be related to its antioxidant properties. These protect the endothelial barrier integrity as well as preserve microvascular blood perfusion by dysfunctions after I-R.

Is red blood cell transfusion of preterm neonates with a Grade 1 intraventricular hemorrhage associated with extension to a Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage?,"An association exists between RBC transfusion and extension of a Grade 1 IVH into a Grade 3 or 4. However, the explanation is unclear and could involve either the reasons transfusion are ordered or the transfusions themselves. Additional studies are needed to discover why neonates are more likely to have IVH extension if transfused."
Do gender-specific differences in adipose distribution and adipocytokines influence adolescent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease?,Gender differences in adolescent NAFLD are related to differences in adipose distribution and adipocytokines. The male phenotype of NAFLD is associated with more adverse metabolic features and greater visceral adiposity than the female phenotype despite the lower prevalence of NAFLD.

Does pallidal dysfunction drive a cerebellothalamic circuit into Parkinson tremor?,"Resting tremor may result from a pathological interaction between the basal ganglia and the cerebellothalamic circuit. The cerebellothalamic circuit, which controls tremor amplitude, appears to be driven into tremor generation when receiving transient signals from the dopamine-depleted basal ganglia. This may explain why basal ganglia dysfunction is required for developing resting tremor, although a cerebellothalamic circuit produces it. Our model also clarifies why neurosurgical interventions targeted at either the basal ganglia or the cerebellothalamic circuit can both suppress tremor."
Is day-to-day discrepancy in Bravo pH monitoring related to the degree of deterioration of the lower esophageal sphincter and severity of reflux disease?,Patients with a discrepancy between days of Bravo pH monitoring have lower esophageal acid exposure. Variability between the 2 days represents early deterioration of the gastroesophageal barrier and indicates less advanced reflux disease.
Does blockade of NMDA GluN2B receptors selectively impair behavioral flexibility but not initial discrimination learning?,"These data suggest that systemic blockade of GluN2B receptors Ro25-6981 does not appear to interfere with the initial acquisition of simple visual or response discriminations. However, these receptors do appear to play a central and selective role in the modification of previously acquired strategies or stimulus-reward associations, facilitating behavioral inhibition so that novel patterns of behavior may emerge."
Are postpartum changes in maternal and infant erythrocyte fatty acids likely to be driven by restoring insulin sensitivity and DHA status?,"Postpartum increases in 18:0, and decreases in 16:0 and 18:1ω9, might derive from reduced insulin-promoted DNL-activity, with more reduced SCD- than Elovl-activity that leaves more 16:0 to be converted to 18:0 (Elovl-activity) than to MUFA (SCD-activity). Postpartum changes in ΣDNL, saturated-FA and MUFA related negatively to RBC-DHA. This concurs with suppression of both SCD- and Elovl-6 activities by DHA, through its influence on SREBP. Infant MUFA and LA increased at expense of their mothers. Sustained transport might be important for myelination (MUFA) and skin barrier development (LA). Maternal postpartum decreases in FADS2-, and apparent increases in FADS1-activity, together with increases in LA, AA, and 22:5ω3, but decrease in DHA, confirm that FADS2 is rate limiting in EFA-desaturation. Maternal LA and AA increases might be the result of rerouting from transplacental transfer to the incorporation into milk lipids and discontinued placental AA-utilization."
Is core temperature variation associated with heart rate variability independent of cardiac index : a study of 278 trauma patients?,"The conclusions of this study are (1) temperature extremes are associated with low HRV, potentially reflecting cardiac autonomic dysfunction; (2) CI increases with temperature; and (3) HRV provides additional physiologic information unobtainable via current invasive cardiac monitoring and current vital signs."
Are less frequent opening of the aortic valve and a continuous flow pump risk factors for postoperative onset of aortic insufficiency in patients with a left ventricular assist device?,"AI, which is hemodynamically significant, develops after implantation of various types of LVADs. Physicians need to be more alert to the development of AI particularly with continuous flow devices."
Does familial segregation of a VSX1 mutation add a new dimension to its role in the causation of keratoconus?,The VSX1 Q175H mutation may be a pathogenic variant with incomplete penetrance. Protein modeling studies show that the mutation affects the DNA binding properties of the protein. This VSX1 variant exhibiting low penetrance may require the presence of some modifier genes or environmental factors for disease presentation. VSX1 may have an important role in the pathogenesis of keratoconus which needs further investigation.
Does localized delivery of interferon-β by Lactobacillus exacerbate experimental colitis?,Our IFNAR1 expression data identifies a correlation between the loss/downregulation of IFNAR1 on DCs and exacerbation of colitis. Our data show that Lactobacillus secreting IFN-β has an immunological effect that in our model results in the exacerbation of colitis. This study underscores that the selection of therapeutics delivered by a bacterial vehicle must take into consideration the simultaneous effects of the vehicle itself.
Does whey protein stimulate postprandial muscle protein accretion more effectively than do casein and casein hydrolysate in older men?,Whey protein stimulates postprandial muscle protein accretion more effectively than do casein and casein hydrolysate in older men. This effect is attributed to a combination of whey's faster digestion and absorption kinetics and higher leucine content. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00557388.
Is pathological upstaging detected in radical cystectomy procedures associated with a significantly worse tumour-specific survival rate for patients with clinical T1 urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder?,"More than one-third of patients with cT1 tumours had an upstaging that was associated with significant prognosis deterioration. Further valid markers are required for an early identification of these patients. LVI represents such a criterion and, therefore, should be evaluated in prospectively designed trials with accurate histopathological assessment of TURB specimens."
Are both surgical clipping and endovascular embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysms associated with long-term improvement in self-reported quantitative headache scores?,This study suggests that surgical and endovascular treatment of a UIA is associated with dramatic improvement in self-reported HA score an average of 32.4 months postoperatively.
Are gliadin-mediated proliferation and innate immune activation in celiac disease due to alterations in vesicular trafficking?,"In this study, we have shown that P31-43 induces both increase of the trans-presented IL-15/IL5R alpha complex on cell surfaces by altering the trafficking of the vesicular compartments as well as proliferation of crypt enterocytes with consequent remodelling of CD mucosa due to a cooperation of IL-15 and EGFR."
Does miRNA-mRNA integrated analysis reveal roles for miRNAs in primary breast tumors?,This study provides a comprehensive dataset as well as methods and system-level results that jointly form a basis for further work on understanding the role of miRNA in primary breast cancer.
Does coronary artery calcification predict long-term mortality in hypertensive adults?,CAC is associated with long-term mortality in asymptomatic hypertensive adults.
Does inhibition of histone deacetylases 1 and 6 enhance cytarabine-induced apoptosis in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia cells?,Our results further confirm that HDACs are bona fide therapeutic targets for treating pediatric AML and suggest that pan-HDACIs may be more beneficial than isoform-specific drugs.
Do presynaptic NMDA receptors mediate IPSC potentiation at GABAergic synapses in developing rat neocortex?,The present results indicate that presynaptic NMDA receptors modulate GABA release onto neocortical pyramidal cells. Presynaptic NR2B subunit containing NMDA receptors are also involved in potentiation at developing GABAergic synapses in rat frontal cortex. Modulation of inhibitory GABAergic synapses by presynaptic NMDA receptors may be important for proper functioning of local cortical networks during development.
Are images of the terminal ileum more convincing than cecal images for verifying the extent of colonoscopy?,"Terminal ileum intubation is achievable rapidly and safely in the majority of patients undergoing colonoscopy. Terminal ileum images provide more convincing evidence of complete examination of the colon than cecal images, even when attempts to capture images specifically of the ICV and appendiceal orifice are made."
Do p2X4 receptors interact with both P2X2 and P2X7 receptors in the form of homotrimers?,We conclude that both pairs of receptors interact in the form of distinct homomers. We urge caution in the interpretation of biochemical evidence indicating heteromer formation in other cases.
Do monogamy and high relatedness preferentially favor the evolution of cooperation?,"The solitary ancestral species to cooperative breeders may have been predominantly monogamous, but it cannot be concluded that monogamy is a predisposing state for the evolution of helping behavior. Monogamy may simply be coincidental to other more important life history characteristics such as nest defense or sequential provisioning of offspring. The differing predictive outcome from a gene-based model also supports arguments that inclusive fitness formulations poorly model some evolutionary questions. Nevertheless, cooperation only evolves when benefits are provided for kin: helping alleles did not increase in frequency in the absence of potential gains in indirect fitness. The key question, therefore, is not whether kin selection occurs, but how best to elucidate the differing evolutionary advantages of genetic relatedness versus genetic diversity."
Is the dopamine transporter decreased in the striatum of subjects with restless legs syndrome?,"The current study found a significant decrease in DAT BP in two independent studies. These results when viewed along with prior RLS SPECT and autopsy studies of DAT, and cell culture studies with iron deficiency and DAT, suggest that membrane-bound striatal DAT, but not total cellular DAT, may be decreased in RLS."
Is excessive daytime sleepiness associated with increased health care utilization among patients referred for assessment of OSA?,"Excessive daytime sleepiness is associated with increased health care utilization among patients referred for assessment of OSA. Further investigation is required to determine whether the findings are related to direct effects of sleepiness, or in part, to interactions with other comorbidity such as OSA."
Does hIF-1-dependent stromal adaptation to ischemia mediate in vivo tumor radiation resistance?,Our results illustrate that tumor radioresistance is mediated by a capacity to compensate for stromal vascular disruption through HIF-1-dependent proangiogenic signaling and that clinically relevant vascular imaging techniques can spatially define mechanisms associated with tumor irradiation.
"Is fetal endothelium dysfunction associated with circulating maternal levels of sE-selectin , sVCAM1 , and sFlt-1 during pre-eclampsia?",High circulating levels of maternal endothelial dysfunction markers present in pre-eclampsia are associated with decreased NO synthesis in fetal endothelium.
Is overweight of adolescent girls associated with self-mutilative behavior?,"Low self-esteem, depression or dysfunctional emotion regulation may be possible mediating factors between overweight and SMB."
Is anatomic location a risk factor for atypical and malignant meningiomas?,"Nonskull-base meningiomas, male sex, and prior surgery impart increased risk for grade II or III pathology. This increased risk translates to probable poorer prognosis and increased likelihood of recurrence after treatment. Thus, it is prudent to take these specific variables into consideration in conjunction with the complete clinical presentation when advising patients regarding their prognosis."
Do extracellular and intraneuronal HMW-AbetaOs represent a molecular basis of memory loss in Alzheimer 's disease model mouse?,"Now, we have evidence that HMW-AβOs are among the earliest manifestation of the AD toxic process in mice and humans. We are certain that our studies move us closer to our goal of finding a therapeutic target and/or confirming the relevance of our therapeutic strategy."
Does differential miRNA expression in omental adipose tissue and in the circulation of obese patients identify novel metabolic biomarkers?,"This study demonstrates that candidate metabolic miRNAs are altered in adipose tissue and circulation of the obese. Omental fat tissue and systemic miRNA levels reflect components of the metabolic syndrome, highlighting their potential as novel biomarkers for this complex syndrome."
Is local-regional radiotherapy and surgery associated with a significant survival advantage in metastatic breast cancer patients?,Surgery and radiotherapy were associated with a significant survival advantage. We argue that local therapy should be considered even in metastatic disease.
Are hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance associated with severe fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis caused by HBV or HCV infection?,"CHB patients had high steatosis prevalence, similar to CHC controls, but lower IR rate. Both steatosis and IR in CHC, and only steatosis in CHB, are independently associated with fibrosis severity."
Are adults with a family history of alcohol related problems more impulsive on measures of response initiation and response inhibition?,"These results suggest that response initiation and response inhibition impulsivity are increased in individuals with family histories of alcohol related problems despite not having alcohol or drug use disorders themselves. In contrast, increased consequence sensitivity impulsivity may be associated with additional risk factors such as more severe family histories of alcohol use disorders, or it may be increased as a consequence of heavy drug or alcohol use."
Do early follow-up outcomes after treatment of degenerative disc disease with the discover cervical disc prosthesis?,"These early results from a small cohort demonstrate that cervical arthroplasty with the Discover artificial cervical disc for the treatment of degenerative cervical disc disease may provide a good clinical outcome and preserves some motion postoperatively. Although early outcomes are promising, this is also a relatively new technology and prosthesis, long-term follow-up studies with larger patient numbers are required to assess safety and efficacy compared with alternative treatments."
Does noninvasive brain stimulation reduce prejudice scores on an implicit association test?,We show that prejudice scores can be significantly reduced by inhibitory rTMS delivered to the bilateral ATLs. This may implicate this area in conceptual associations that lead to overgeneralization and stereotyping of social groups.
Does bilateral amygdala damage impair the acquisition and use of common ground in social interaction?,"These results support the conclusion that the amygdala, a structure critical for social and emotional processing, plays an important role in the acquisition and use of common ground and in social communication more broadly."
Do t helper cells promote disease progression of osteoarthritis by inducing macrophage inflammatory protein-1γ?,"CD4(+) T cells were activated during the onset of OA, but cartilage damage was more prominent at a later stage. CD4(+) T cells were involved in the pathogenesis of OA: they induced MIP-1γ expression and subsequent osteoclast formation."
Is cerebral acetylcholinesterase activity decreased in MS patients with cognitive impairment?,"In the patient group regional AChE activities had inverse correlations with Word learning and MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) scores. In the group of cognitively deteriorated MS patients no change in cerebral AChE activity, compared with controls, was observed, but within the patient group more pronounced cognitive symptoms were associated with higher cerebral AChE activity."
"Is olfactory threshold impaired in early , active multiple sclerosis?","We report evidence for qualitatively distinct hyposmia in MS, with increased smell threshold in the early inflammatory phases of the disease and impaired identification with a more widespread chronic disease."
Do individual preferences and social interactions determine the aggregation of woodlice?,"Here we show for the first time that aggregation in woodlice implies a strong social component and results from a trade-off between individual preferences and inter-attraction between individuals. Moreover, our results reveal that the response to the heterogeneities affects only the location of the aggregates and not the level of aggregation, and demonstrate the strong inter-attraction between conspecifics which can outweigh individual preferences. This inter-attraction can lead to situations that could seem sub-optimal."
Does a glycyrrhizin-containing preparation reduce hepatic steatosis induced by hepatitis C virus protein and iron in mice?,These results suggest that SNMC prevents hepatic steatosis possibly by protecting mitochondria against oxidative stress induced by HCV proteins and iron overload.
Is the waning of teriparatide effect on bone formation markers in postmenopausal osteoporosis associated with increasing serum levels of DKK1?,Long-term (>12 months) treatment with TPD is associated with an increase in serum levels of DKK1 that might be associated with the appearance of declining effect on bone formation markers.
"Are unreplaced sex steroid deficiency , corticotropin deficiency , and lower IGF-I associated with lower bone mineral density in adults with growth hormone deficiency : a KIMS database analysis?",Hormone variables associated with lower sBMD in patients with adult-onset GHD include unreplaced sex steroid deficiency and corticotropin deficiency in the LS and lower IGF-I SDS in the FN.
Does nanosized rods agglomerate as a new approach for formulation of a dry powder inhaler?,The results obtained lend support to the hypothesis that controlled agglomeration strategies provide an efficient approach for the delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs into the lungs.
Does attention bias away from threat during life threatening danger predict PTSD symptoms at one-year follow-up?,Attention bias away from threat during acute stress may relate to risk for PTSD. This suggests that neurocognitive measures may index risk for PTSD.
Does immunonutrition with long-chain fatty acids prevent activation of macrophages in the gut wall?,"During sepsis, activated macrophages are released from the gut into mesenteric lymph. However, an enteral diet with lipid is able to suppress the inflammatory cytokine release from mesenteric lymph leukocytes."
Do distinct cerebrospinal fluid proteomes differentiate post-treatment lyme disease from chronic fatigue syndrome?,"nPTLS and CFS have distinguishing CSF protein complements. Each condition has a number of CSF proteins that can be useful in providing candidates for future validation studies and insights on the respective mechanisms of pathogenesis. Distinguishing nPTLS and CFS permits more focused study of each condition, and can lead to novel diagnostics and therapeutic interventions."
Is improving antibiotic use in the hospital : Focusing on positive blood cultures an effective option?,"In complement to the laboratory report, a computer-generated alert used by the IDS was useful for the management of pBC in hospital. The impact of IDS counselling was more effective when the evaluation was restricted to medical and surgical wards."
Does respiratory pulse pressure variation fail to predict fluid responsiveness in acute respiratory distress syndrome?,"During protective mechanical ventilation for early ARDS, partly because of insufficient changes in pleural pressure, ΔRESPPP performance was poor. Careful fluid challenges may be a safe alternative."
Are tumor-infiltrating macrophages associated with metastasis suppression in high-grade osteosarcoma : a rationale for treatment with macrophage activating agents?,"In contrast to most other tumor types, TAMs are associated with reduced metastasis and improved survival in high-grade osteosarcoma. This study provides a biological rationale for the adjuvant treatment of high-grade osteosarcoma patients with macrophage activating agents, such as muramyl tripeptide."
Does clinical utility of 4D FDG-PET/CT scan in radiation treatment planning?,"In comparison to 3D PET, 4D PET may better define the full physiologic extent of moving tumors and improve radiation treatment planning for lung tumors. In addition, reduction of blurring from free-breathing images may reveal additional information regarding regional disease."
Does psychological approach to successful ageing predict future quality of life in older adults?,"Only the psychological approach to successful ageing independently predicted QoL at follow-up. Successful ageing is not only about the maintenance of health, but about maximising one's psychological resources, namely self-efficacy and resilience. Increasing use of preventive care, better medical management of morbidity, and changing lifestyles in older people may have beneficial effects on health and longevity, but may not improve their QoL. Adding years to life and life to years may require two distinct and different approaches, one physical and the other psychological. Follow-up health status, number of supporters and social activities, and self-rated active ageing also significantly predicted QoL at follow-up. The longitudinal sample bias towards healthy survivors is likely to underestimate these results."
Are occult and previous hepatitis B virus infection associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in United States patients with chronic hepatitis C?,"Although almost half the patients in the HALT-C Trial had serological evidence of previous HBV infection, there was no difference in prevalence of anti-HBc in serum or HBV DNA in liver between patients who did or did not develop HCC. In the United States, neither previous nor occult HBV infection is an important factor in HCC development among patients with advanced chronic hepatitis C."
Does response to hepatitis B vaccine differ by birthweight among neonates?,"These data support the hypothesis that birthweight has an effect on response to HBV vaccine. Using the same needle length for immunization of macrosomic infants for hepatitis B reveals significantly reduced antibody titers, this can be related also to possible endogenous factors. Further studies are needed to assess appropriate needle length and effects of other factors on vaccine reactogenicity for macrosomic infants."
Does recognition of iodixanol by dendritic cells increase the cellular response in delayed allergic reactions to contrast media?,"These results provide evidence for a DC-mediated mechanism in delayed allergic reactions to CM, influencing T cell proliferation and cytokine production. These new insights will be helpful for designing immunotherapeutic strategies and in vitro diagnostic tests of CM-delayed reactions."
Does ultrasound-guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block enhance postoperative blood flow in arteriovenous fistulas?,"When used for AVF access surgery, infraclavicular brachial plexus block provides higher blood flow in the radial artery and AVF than is achieved with infiltration anesthesia."
"Are pro-inflammatory cytokines raised in extrahepatic portal venous obstruction , with minimal hepatic encephalopathy?","Patients with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction have inflammation and hyperammonemia made evident by higher blood TNF-α, IL-6, ammonia, and brain glutamine levels. A significant correlation between hyperammonemia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and cerebral edema on DTI in various brain regions suggests that both these factors play a role in the pathogenesis of MHE in these patients."
Does a pediatric amino acid solution for total parenteral nutrition affect liver function test results in neonates?,"These findings indicate that this amino acid solution for pediatrics has no significant effect on LFTs in neonates, even when high doses of amino acids (3.5 g/kg per day) are infused."
Is up-regulation of transferrin receptor expression in hepatocytes by habitual alcohol drinking implicated in hepatic iron overload in alcoholic liver disease?,"The up-regulation of TfR expression in hepatocytes is implicated in hepatic iron overload in ALD, and habitual alcohol drinking is an important factor for the induction of TfR expression."
Does the endothelin antagonist BQ123 reduce pulmonary vascular resistance after surgical intervention for congenital heart disease?,"Postoperative elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance in children after surgical intervention for congenital heart disease is responsive to endothelin-A blockade with BQ123. Increased levels of endothelin-1 predict the response to this therapy, which might become an important addition to the clinical armamentarium in postoperative pulmonary hypertensive disease."
Do serum pancreatic enzymes define the pancreatic phenotype in patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome?,Serum pancreatic enzymes are useful for determining the pancreatic phenotype and confirming the diagnosis of SDS.
Does in human IgA nephropathy uteroglobin play the role inferred from transgenic mice?,"This first report of human IgA nephropathy after the publication of the mouse model shows that UG is not reduced in circulation and is even increased in IgA-Fn complexes. Because aberrant IgA1 glycosylation is the event initiating IgA nephropathy in humans, we speculate that the enhanced incorporation of UG into IgA-Fn complexes might represent feedback to reduce the formation of macromolecular aggregates."
Is thinking life worth living . A population survey of Great Britain?,Reducing psychiatric morbidity in the population as a whole might also decrease the frequency of suicidal thoughts. Policies which improve social support at a population level might also have a large impact on prevalence of suicidal thoughts.
Is electrocardiography unreliable in detecting potentially lethal hyperkalaemia in haemodialysis patients?,"Haemodialysis patients with hyperkalaemia may not exhibit the usual electrocardiographic sequella of hyperkalaemia, possibly due in part to fluctuations in serum calcium concentration. Thus, the absence of electrocardiographic changes in hyperkalaemic haemodialysis patients should be interpreted with caution."
Is relation between walking speed and muscle strength affected by somatosensory loss in multiple sclerosis?,"In patients with undifferentiated MS there is some correlation between gait speed and muscle strength. In the case of sensory loss, a higher contribution of both flexor and extensors of the lower limbs was observed, suggesting that muscular compensation occurred in this situation to maintain gait speed. These results are relevant to assess rehabilitation modalities in MS."
Is a single growth hormone ( GH ) determination sufficient for the diagnosis of GH-deficiency in adult patients using the growth hormone releasing hormone plus growth hormone releasing peptide-6 test?,"The GHRH + GHRP-6 test is a convenient, safe and reliable, provocative test of GH reserve in adults, which can be reduced to a single fixed GH determination 30 minutes after stimulus."
Does fibroblast growth factor 2 induce increased calvarial osteoblast proliferation and cranial suture fusion?,"These results indicate that FGF2 can promote rat osteoblast attachment and normal cell morphology as well as induce cell proliferation. In calvarial organ culture, FGF2 treatment produced an enhanced suture fusion. These results provide further support for a critical role for FGF2 in cranial suture development. These studies also present a new quantitative approach to evaluating the effect of suture-perturbing growth factors on cranial suture fusion."
Do pharmacy data identify poorly adherent patients with schizophrenia at increased risk for admission?,Many health care systems may be able to use pharmacy data to identify poorly adherent patients with schizophrenia. These patients are at-risk for admission and may benefit from intervention.
"Is the pregnancy-related decrease in fasting plasma homocysteine explained by folic acid supplementation , hemodilution , or a decrease in albumin in a longitudinal study?","This study refutes the previous explanations for the reduction in plasma tHcy known to occur in pregnancy, namely, folic acid supplementation, hemodilution, and a decrease in serum albumin. We suggest that the changes may be endocrine-based."
Is higher maternal plasma docosahexaenoic acid during pregnancy associated with more mature neonatal sleep-state patterning?,The sleep patterns of infants born to mothers with higher plasma phospholipid DHA suggest greater CNS maturity.
Is interleukin-6 an independent predictor of mortality in patients starting dialysis treatment?,The present study demonstrates that the strong predictive value of elevated IL-6 levels for poor outcome in ESRD patients is similar in both HD and PD patients starting treatment.
Does mR correlate of cerebral atrophy in patients with multiple sclerosis?,"This study suggests that brain atrophy in MS is not simply due to axonal loss, but rather reflects a more generalized process that involves various brain tissue components. Damage to the normal-appearing tissue rather than the extent and intrinsic pathology of macroscopic lesions seems to be important in the destructive process leading to MS-related irreversible cerebral atrophy."
Does dynamic-enhanced MRI predict metastatic potential of invasive ductal breast cancer?,"The current series suggests that the SI index could distinguish patients with high risk of distant metastasis from disease free patients, preoperatively. If a suitable borderline value were established, the quantitative dynamic parameter determined by MRI may be useful for predicting the prognosis of breast cancer patients."
Are p53 gene mutations associated with poor survival in low and low-intermediate risk diffuse large B-cell lymphomas?,p53 alterations constitute a pejorative biological indicator able to discriminate among clinically defined lower risk patients with DLBCL.
Does oral stimulation accelerate the transition from tube to oral feeding in preterm infants?,An early oral stimulation program accelerates the transition to full oral feedings in preterm infants. This was associated with greater overall intake and rate of milk transfer observed in the experimental group when compared with the control group.
Is simultaneous anus and bowel operation preferable for anal fistula in Crohn 's disease?,"Healing of Crohn's anal fistula was significantly better in the simultaneous group than in the control group, and the recurrence rate was lower in the simultaneous group. Seton drainage for anal fistula in Crohn's disease was effective and preserved sphincter function."
"Do age and copper intake affect copper absorption , measured with the use of 65Cu as a tracer , in young infants?",Copper absorption in young infants is high but does not respond to copper intake within the range tested.
Is underreporting of energy intake less common among pregnant women in Indonesia?,"Levels of underreporting were low among the pregnant Indonesian women during the second and third trimesters. The low EI/BMR ratio during the first trimester likely reflects a true low intake due to nausea, rather than underreporting. Risk factors for being an underreporter included those known from developed countries, i.e. obesity and low education."
Are the lower-generation polypropylenimine dendrimers effective gene-transfer agents?,The generation 2 polypropylenimine dendrimer combines a sufficient level of DNA binding with a low level of cell cytoxicity to give it optimum in vitro gene transfer activity.
Does anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment restore the gut barrier in Crohn 's disease?,Inhibiting the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor dramatically reduces gut inflammation and largely restores the gut barrier in Crohn's disease. Our data confirm the central role of TNF in gut barrier modulation in inflammatory conditions in vivo.
Is urinary trypsinogen activation peptide more accurate than hematocrit in determining severity in patients with acute pancreatitis : a prospective study?,"In comparison to admission Hct, urinary TAP was more accurate in determining severity in patients with acute pancreatitis by Atlanta, APACHE II, and Ranson criteria. We conclude that urinary TAP is a more accurate predictor of severity in patients with acute pancreatitis compared with Hct. Urinary TAP should be used to determine severity in patients early in the course of acute pancreatitis."
Is the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System ( CGMS ) in type 1 diabetic children the way to reduce hypoglycemic risk?,"The CGMS is a useful device not only for detecting unrecognized hypoglycemia, but also for modifying insulin therapy in order to reduce hypoglycemic events. The system appears to be useful in avoiding long exposure to hypoglycemia."
"Are estrogen receptor-alpha and estrogen receptor-beta present in the human growth plate in childhood and adolescence , in identical distribution?",Our findings indicate that the hypertrophic chondrocyte is the main target cell for estrogen action within the growth plate. The presence of ER in prepubertal children suggests that estrogens play a role in skeletal maturation under physiological conditions also in this age-group.
"Are hiatal hernia size , Barrett 's length , and severity of acid reflux all risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma?",High-grade dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma seem to stem from an extreme and unfavorable constellation of all risk factors that are generally held responsible for the development of GERD and Barrett's esophagus.
Is apoptotic activity increased in brain cortex infarct after hypothermic circulatory arrest in a porcine model?,"The apoptotic index was significantly increased in brain cortex infarcts of animals that survived 7 days after HCA, whereas only a few apoptotic cells were observed in noninfarcted areas of these animals as well as in animals that died on the first postoperative day. Further studies are required to elucidate the timing of development of brain infarction after HCA and whether neuroprotective strategies targeting the apoptotic process may mitigate brain damage."
Do skeletal fractures negatively correlate with overall survival in men with prostate cancer?,"Our results suggest that skeletal fracture in patients with prostate cancer is an independent and adverse predictor of survival. Consideration for screening men at greatest risk via bone mineral density measurements and initiating empirical skeletal therapies (bisphosphonates, estrogens and so forth) may be warranted. This recommendation awaits validation through prospective randomized trials."
Is d-chiro-inositol more effective than myo-inositol in preventing folate-resistant mouse neural tube defects?,D-chiro-inositol offers a safe and effective method for preventing folic acid-resistant NTDs in the curly tail mouse. This raises the possibility of using inositol as an adjunct therapy to folic acid for prevention of NTDs in humans.
Does focal cooling suppress spontaneous epileptiform activity without changing the cortical motor threshold?,"In this patient with tumor-related epilepsy, focal cooling of the cortex reproducibly abolished interictal epileptiform discharges without changing the motor threshold to electrical stimulation."
Is the N-demethylation of the doxepin isomers mainly catalyzed by the polymorphic CYP2C19?,The present study demonstrates a significant contribution of the polymorphic CYP2C19 to the N-demethylation of doxepin. CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 play a minor role and CYP3A4 does not contribute substantially.
Do aBR thresholds to tonebursts gated with Blackman and linear windows in adults with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss?,"There were no clear differences between Blackman- and linearly gated tonebursts in terms of how well ABR thresholds predicted pure-tone thresholds at 2000 and 4000 Hz. In general audiometric thresholds were predicted with good accuracy (+/-15 dB) by the toneburst ABR thresholds. The 4000-Hz audiometric threshold was underestimated in one subject with a very steeply sloping hearing loss by both Blackman- and linearly gated toneburst ABR thresholds, indicating that ipsilateral masking such as notched noise would be needed to ensure frequency specificity in this and similar cases."
Do echocardiography-derived variables predict outcome in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with or without a restrictive filling pattern?,"RFP is a powerful independent predictor of mortality in patients with nonischemic DCM. The risk associated with RFP is greatest among patients who had short isovolumic relaxation time, mitral regurgitation, incoordinate wall-motion, and depressed amplitude of right ventricular long axis excursion. Thus, echocardiography-derived variables may stratify patients with heart failure with DCM who are at high risk, for whom aggressive medical treatment or heart transplantation should be considered early."
Does the graft help to define the character of the alloimmune response?,"In the DBA/2-> C57B1/6 strain combination, cardiac allografts induce pro-inflammatory immunity and allograft rejection, while kidney allografts induce anti-inflammatory immunity and allograft acceptance despite the fact that both organs display the same strong MHC disparities and are implanted at the same location. Anti-inflammatory immunity and allograft acceptance are displayed by cardiac allograft recipients when they are transiently treated with select immunosuppressants. Thus, multiple immune response options are available to the organ allograft recipient, and the choice is determined, to some degree, by the allograft, itself."
Is apolipoprotein E4 only a weak predictor of dementia and cognitive decline in the general population?,The APOE epsilon4 allele is a weaker predictor for dementia in the general population than for AD. This may be because dementia can be caused by non-AD pathological processes and because most prevalent dementia occurs at an age when the APOE epsilon4 effect on AD risk (and therefore dementia) has started to decline.
Are mutations in NOD2 associated with fibrostenosing disease in patients with Crohn 's disease?,"In this description of a genotype/phenotype correlation in CD patients and NOD2 variants, data suggest that variation in this gene contributes to the occurrence of fibrostenotic CD of the small bowel."
Does acute administration of citalopram facilitate memory consolidation in healthy volunteers?,"These results indicate that augmentation of serotonergic neurotransmission is associated with increased memory consolidation, which may be relevant to its therapeutic and cognitive actions in acutely depressed patients."
Does use of a variable-stiffness colonoscope allow completion of colonoscopy after failure with the standard adult colonoscope?,A variable-stiffness colonoscope allowed completion of colonoscopy in all patients without obstruction who had an incomplete colonoscopy with the standard colonoscope. Further study is needed to determine whether the variable-stiffness colonoscope should be used routinely for colonoscopy.
Does large artery stiffness predict ischemic threshold in patients with coronary artery disease?,"Within a patient group with moderate CAD, large artery stiffness was a major determinant of myocardial ischemic threshold."
Does tobacco point of sale advertising increase positive brand user imagery?,"The results presented here support restrictions being placed on advertising at point of sale, since such ads have the potential to increase positive brand user imagery directly in the situation where a product purchase can take place, and hence the potential to increase the likelihood of impulse purchasing."
Is expression of human intestinal mucin modulated by the beta-galactoside binding protein galectin-3 in colon cancer?,The beta-galactoside binding protein galectin-3 modulates the expression of its major ligand MUC2 mucin in human colon cancer cells. This may have important implications for understanding the role of galectin-3 in colon cancer metastasis.
Does mild opioid deprivation increase the degree that opioid-dependent outpatients discount delayed heroin and money?,Opioid deprivation increased the degree to which dependent individuals discounted delayed heroin and money. Understanding the conditions that affect how drug-dependent individuals discount delayed rewards might help us understand the myopic choices made by such individuals and help improve treatment outcomes.
Do men with nonobstructive azoospermia have Leydig cell hypertrophy but not hyperplasia?,"These results suggest that men with nonobstructive azoospermia and those with normal spermatogenesis have an equivalent number of Leydig cells. However, the Leydig cells are hypertrophic and occupy a larger proportion of total testis volume in men with nonobstructive azoospermia. Therefore, patients with spermatogenic failure show Leydig cell hypertrophy but not hyperplasia."
Are unsaturated iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation equally reliable in detection of HFE hemochromatosis?,Transferrin saturation and UIBC have equal reliability in ability to predict hemochromatosis. UIBC should be considered as an alternative to transferrin saturation in detection of hemochromatosis.
"Are specific codon 13 K-ras mutations predictive of clinical outcome in colorectal cancer patients , whereas codon 12 K-ras mutations are associated with mucinous histotype?","Our results suggest that codon 12 K-ras mutations may have a role in the mucinous differentiation pathway, while codon 13 mutations have biological relevance in terms of colorectal cancer clinical outcome."
Do low levels of leisure-time physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness predict development of the metabolic syndrome?,"In particular, high-risk men engaging in currently recommended levels of physical activity were less likely to develop the metabolic syndrome than sedentary men.

Does anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction result in alterations in gait variability?,"The larger LyE values indicate that the reconstructed knees of both reconstructed groups exhibit more divergence in the movement trajectories during gait. The larger Lye values found in the intact leg in both reconstructed groups could be interpreted as a compensatory mechanism. However, the increased divergence found in both limbs may present an alternative explanation for the impaired neuromuscular performance and increased susceptibility to future pathology, which is supported by the increased amount of osteoarthritis found in ACL-reconstructed patients."
Do intragraft tubular vimentin and CD44 expression correlate with long-term renal allograft function and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy?,"Summarizing, de novo tubular expression of CD44 and vimentin can function as surrogate marker for IF/TA and eGFR at 12 months.

Does microarray analysis of a salamander hopeful monster reveal transcriptional signatures of paedomorphic brain development?,"Many of the unique tiger salamander transcriptional responses are probably associated with metamorphic biological processes. However, the axolotl also showed unique patterns of transcription early in development. In particular, the axolotl showed a genome-wide reduction in mRNA abundance across loci, including genes that regulate hypothalamic-pituitary activities. This suggests that an axolotls failure to undergo anatomical metamorphosis late in the larval period is indirectly associated with a mechanism(s) that acts earlier in development to broadly program transcription. The axolotl hopeful monster provides a model to identify mechanisms of early brain development that proximally and ultimately affect the expression of adult phenotypes."

Further analyses in larger European cohorts and replication in patients of different ethnicity, as well as functional studies, may lead to possible early detection of patients at risk for developing MMD and subsequently to future preventive therapies."
Does early maternal deprivation affect dentate gyrus structure and emotional learning in adult female rats?,"Although early life stress exposure did not impair hippocampus-dependent functioning in female offspring, it irreversibly affected DG structure by reducing cell numbers. This may be relevant for the reduced hippocampal volume observed in depression and the increased vulnerability of women to develop depression."
Does a functional NOS1 promoter polymorphism interact with adverse environment on functional and dysfunctional impulsivity?,"This study provides further evidence that short alleles of NOS1 ex1f-VNTR go along with impulsive behavior. In the absence of adverse environmental conditions, this may lead to a beneficial effect as functional forms of impulsivity are affected. This however is reversed under negative conditions, as dysfunctional impulsivity is increased under these circumstances. This data provides evidence that NOS1 ex1f-VNTR is subject to balancing selection potentially explaining persistence of the risk allele in the population."

Furthermore, the prevalence widely varied with age at any given bone value."
Does acute tryptophan depletion attenuate conscious appraisal of social emotional signals in healthy female volunteers?,"ATD attenuates the attractiveness of positive faces and the negative intensity of threatening faces, suggesting that serotonin contributes specifically to the appraisal of the social salience of both positive and negative salient social emotional cues. We found no evidence that serotonin affects unconscious processing of negative emotional stimuli. These novel findings implicate serotonin in conscious aspects of active social and behavioural engagement and extend knowledge regarding the effects of ATD on emotional perception."
Are current clinical criteria for Lynch syndrome sensitive enough to identify MSH6 mutation carriers?,"Amsterdam criteria and each of the Bethesda criteria were inadequate for identifying MSH6 mutation-carrying kindreds. MSH6 mutations may be more common than currently assumed, and the penetrance/expression of MSH6 mutations, as derived from families meeting current clinical criteria, may be misleading. To increase detection rate of MMR mutation carriers, all cancers in the Lynch syndrome tumour spectrum should be subjected to immunohistochemical analysis and/or analysis for microsatellite instability."

It also allows the visualisation and quantification of alterations in leaf structure alongside changes in leaf functioning observed under environmental constraints. Data obtained using this procedure can further be integrated in leaf development and functioning models.
Does arsenic abrogate the estrogen-signaling pathway in the rat uterus?,"Together, the results indicate that arsenic disrupted the circulating levels of gonadotropins and estradiol, led to degeneration of luminal epithelial, stromal and myometrial cells of the rat uterus and downregulated the downstream components of the estrogen signaling pathway. Since development and functional maintenance of the uterus is under the influence of estradiol, arsenic-induced structural degeneration may be attributed to the reduction in circulating estradiol levels. Downregulation of the estrogen receptor and estrogen-responsive genes in response to arsenic indicates a mechanism of suppression of female reproductive functions by an environmental toxicant that is contra-mechanistic to that of estrogen."

Is face coding bilateral in the female brain?,"LORETA reconstruction showed a significant left and right asymmetry in the activation of the fusiform gyrus (BA19), in women and men, respectively. The present data reveal a lesser degree of lateralization of brain functions related to face coding in women than men. In this light, they may provide an explanation of the inconsistencies in the available literature concerning the asymmetric activity of left and right occipito-temporal cortices devoted to face perception during processing of face identity, structure, familiarity or affective content."
Does growth hormone status predict left ventricular mass in patients after cure of acromegaly?,"Patients who develop GHD following cure of acromegaly do not demonstrate elevated LV mass, in contrast to patients with a history of acromegaly but normal GH levels or to patients with active acromegaly. This suggests that GH status after treatment of acromegaly correlates with LV mass, and that, in GH sufficient patients, reversal of remodeling may be slower than previously thought. These data suggest that it will be important to determine whether GH replacement alters left ventricular morphology over time."
Is immune cell-derived c3 required for autoimmune diabetes induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin?,The data reveal a key role for immune cell-derived C3 in the pathogenesis of murine multiple low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetes and support the concept that immune cell mediated diabetes is in part complement-dependent.

Our data suggest that the sensitivity of chondrocytes to the changes in the microenvironment can be adjusted by altering the content of matrilins in pericellular matrix. This finding supports a critical role of pericellular matrix in chondrocyte mechano-transduction and has important implications in cartilage tissue engineering and mechanical adaptation.
Does tNFA-308G > A polymorphism influence the TNF-alpha response to altered vaginal flora?,The TNFA-308G>A polymorphism influences the local TNF-alpha response to altered vaginal microflora. This suggests that the nature of the host response to microbial invasion in the lower female genital is genetically determined.
Do re-evaluation of axillary skip metastases in the era of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer?,"These results suggest that skip axillary metastases are actual skip metastases, not a continuation of undetected level I micrometastases. Moreover, none of the clinical and histopathological measures of primary tumors are predictors of the presence of skip metastases."
Does rheumatoid arthritis association with the FCRL3 -169C polymorphism is restrict to PTPN22 1858T-homozygous individuals in a Canadian population?,"Our findings support an association of RA with an FCRL3 functional polymorphism and reveal that this association is stronger in the absence of PTPN22 risk genotypes. These findings support a genetic heterogeneity across RA populations, suggesting that both the FCRL3 and PTPN22 genes play roles in RA susceptibility, but in different individuals."
Are high plasma aldosterone levels on admission associated with death in patients presenting with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction?,"Plasma aldosterone levels on admission among patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI are associated with early and late adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality. The association between high aldosterone levels and late mortality is independent of age, heart failure, and reperfusion status. Such results underline the pivotal role of aldosterone and justify a randomized trial to assess the early administration of aldosterone antagonists in the setting of STEMI."
Is [ Results of treatment for acromegaly in 53 patients : it time of intervention ]?,The cure rates obtained in this group of patients are clearly lower than those reported abroad. These results stress the importance of having a national registry of acromegaly and the need to train neurosurgeons in the treatment of pituitary tumors.
"Is computed tomography-diagnosed emphysema , not airway obstruction , associated with the prognostic outcome of early-stage lung cancer?","Computed tomography-diagnosed emphysema, but not airway obstruction, is associated with poor prognosis in smokers with early-stage lung cancer. Thus, routine computed tomography densitometry in smokers with lung cancer should be mandatory."
Are changes in inflammatory cytokines related to impaired glucose tolerance in offspring of type 2 diabetic subjects?,Nondiabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic subjects have changes in the levels of inflammatory cytokines. The level of IL-1Ra seems to be the most sensitive marker of cytokine response in the pre-diabetic state.
Are embryo morphology and development dependent on the chromosomal complement?,"A correlation between embryo development and chromosomal complement makes the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities significantly higher in embryos dividing according to a time frame and a symmetry plan which are different from what are expected. The type of fragmentation is also related to chromosomal status, which explains why the extrusion of fragments might severely affect embryo viability."

Does circumstances and consequences of fall in elderly people with vestibular disorder?,"Fear and tendency to fall are referred by the majority of chronically dizzy elderly. Fall are more frequent in the morning, in the home and during walking. The propulsion direction is mentioned by half of the elderly and the most common cause for falls are dizziness and stumbling. The number of falls is significantly associated with activity restrictions after the last fall and with the causes for falling (slipping and dizziness)."
Does dietary carbohydrate source influence molecular fingerprints of the rat faecal microbiota?,"Even though sucrose and cornstarch are both easily digestible and are not expected to reach the large intestine, the DGGE band patterns obtained indicated that these carbohydrates indeed affected the composition of bacteria in the large gut. Also the two fructans resulted in completely different molecular fingerprints of the faecal microbiota, indicating that even though they are chemically similar, different intestinal bacteria ferment them. Comparison of DNA-based and RNA-based profiles suggested that two species within the phylum Bacteroidetes were not abundant in numbers but had a particularly high ribosome content in the animals fed with inulin."
Does isotype distribution of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies in undifferentiated arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis reflect an ongoing immune response?,"These data indicate development of the anti-CCP isotype repertoire into full usage early in the course of arthritis. The sustained presence of IgM anti-CCP indicates ongoing recruitment of new B cells into the anti-CCP response, reflecting a continuous (re)activation of the RA-specific anti-CCP response during the course of anti-CCP-positive arthritis."
Does rosiglitazone attenuate suppression of RXRalpha-dependent gene expression in inflamed liver?,Rosi directly attenuates the suppressive effects of inflammation-induced cell signaling on nuclear RXRalpha levels in liver.

Does difficulty of cardiac arrest rhythm identification correlate with length of chest compression pause before defibrillation?,Long cardiopulmonary resuscitation pauses before defibrillation are likely due to human factors during the resuscitation and not due to inherent difficulties with rhythm identification. This preliminary work highlights the need for more research and training in the area of team performance and human factors during resuscitation.
Do antibodies to I2 predict clinical response to fecal diversion in Crohn 's disease?,Expression of I2 antibodies against a bacterial antigen of Pseudomonas fluorescens was highly associated with clinical response to fecal diversion in CD patients.
Do recurrent insertion and duplication generate networks of transposable element sequences in the Drosophila melanogaster genome?,Rapid restructuring of the genomic landscape by transposition and duplication has recently added hundreds of kilobases of TE sequence to pericentromeric regions in D. melanogaster. These events create ragged transitions between unique and repetitive sequences in the zone between euchromatic and beta-heterochromatic regions. Complex relationships of TE nesting in beta-heterochromatic regions raise the possibility of a co-suppression network that may act as a global surveillance system against the majority of TE families in D. melanogaster.
Is depression in vascular dementia quantitatively and qualitatively different from depression in Alzheimer 's disease?,"Depression in VaD was quantitatively and qualitatively different from that in AD regardless of the severity of dementia and gender; depression was more prevalent, severer and more retarded and vegetative in VaD than in AD."
Is liver fibrogenesis due to cholestasis associated with increased Smad7 expression and Smad3 signaling?,"Hepatocytes of damaged liver tissue display increased TGF-beta signaling via Smad3. Further, negative feedback regulation of TGF-beta signaling by increased Smad7 expression in activated hepatic stellate cells occurs, however does not interfere with fibrogenesis."
Is the IL-6 promoter polymorphism associated with disease activity and disability in systemic sclerosis?,The GG homozygosis was found to be associated with a higher degree of illness activity and disability in SSc patients. No statistically significant differences were found between SSc patients and healthy controls with respect to the -597 allele distribution.

Does heart-type fatty acid-binding protein permit early risk stratification of pulmonary embolism?,H-FABP is a promising early indicator of right ventricular injury and dysfunction in acute PE. It may help optimize risk stratification algorithms and treatment strategies.
Is immunohistochemical detection using the new rabbit monoclonal antibody SP1 of estrogen receptor in breast cancer superior to mouse monoclonal antibody 1D5 in predicting survival?,SP1 represents an improved standard for ER immunohistochemistry assessment in breast cancer.
Do large annuloplasty rings facilitate mitral valve repair in Barlow 's disease?,Mitral valve repair can be predictably performed in Barlow's disease with excellent early outcomes. Large annuloplasty rings help minimize the risk of systolic anterior motion and are an important adjunct to established repair techniques in this patient cohort with large annular size and excess leaflet tissue.
Is retinopathy reduced during experimental diabetes in a mouse model of outer retinal degeneration?,Loss of the outer retina reduces the severity of diabetic retinopathy in a murine model. Oxygen usage by the photoreceptors during dark adaptation may contribute to retinal hypoxia and exacerbate the progression of diabetic retinopathy.
Does effect of antihistamine eye drop on the conjunctival provocation test with Japanese cedar pollen allergen?,"Preadministration of antihistamine eye drops suppressed the symptoms induced by the allergen, which suggests that this is an effective early therapy for Japanese cedar pollinosis, if it is started before the pollen season. However, self-protection by patients using a mask may not be effective enough to suppress nasal symptoms during the pollen season, requiring them to additionally wear glasses to avoid exposure to the allergen."
Do goals and intentions mediate efficacy beliefs and declining physical activity in high school girls?,"These observations of longitudinal relations elaborate application of self-efficacy theory and the theory of planned behavior to physical activity by showing that goal setting and satisfaction mediate the relations of self-efficacy and perceived behavioral control with changes in intention and physical activity. The results encourage additional research to identify the sources and development of physical activity goals, and their attainment, among girls, and whether experimental manipulation of goals and intentions can mitigate the decline in girls' physical activity during high school."
Does an aggressive surgical approach lead to long-term survival in patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors?,"We show that an aggressive surgical approach leads to long-term survival in patients with malignant PETs. Although long-term cure can only be achieved in a proportion of patients with malignant PETs, significant long-term palliation can be achieved."
Is repeated sputum microscopy essential for monitoring tuberculosis treatment response?,"The yield of a second on-the-spot sputum specimen is negligible, provided that the first smear is from an overnight specimen. From the data available, it is evident that repeated follow-up smears are not essential for documenting treatment outcome."
"Are age-related increases in circulating inflammatory markers in men independent of BMI , blood pressure and blood lipid concentrations?","Plasma concentrations of some inflammatory markers (sVCAM-1, IL-6, MCP-1, 6Ckine, IP-10) are positively correlated with age, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors. This suggests that age-related inflammation may not be driven by recognised risk factors."
Is adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette B1 ( ABCB1 ) ( multidrug resistance 1 ) G2677T/A gene polymorphism associated with high risk of lung cancer?,"The current results taken together suggest that, aside from other known causes of lung cancer, such as tobacco smoke, the existence of polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene and, specifically, the presence of the G2677T mutation can be crucial in conferring susceptibility to lung cancer. Further studies comprising larger populations are needed to confirm these preliminary findings."

Does tracheostomy improve the outcome of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation : a propensity analysis?,Tracheostomy does not seem to reduce intensive care unit mortality when performed in unselected patients but may represent a burden after intensive care unit discharge.
Does uptake of cholesterol by the retina occur primarily via a low density lipoprotein receptor-mediated process?,"The retina is capable of rapid uptake of circulating LDL via an LDLR-mediated process primarily occurring in the RPE and also possibly Müller cells. Despite the dominance of HDL over LDL in rat serum, LDL appears to be the preferred carrier for cholesterol transport to and uptake by the retina. The results also suggest that blood-borne LDL represents a significant contributor to the steady-state levels of cholesterol and possibly other lipids in the retina."
Is intraretinal lipid transport dependent on high density lipoprotein-like particles and class B scavenger receptors?,The presence and specific localization of these well-known lipid transport proteins suggest that the retina employs an internal lipid transport mechanism that involves processing and maturation of HDL-like particles.
Is [ Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome in children associated with obesity ]?,"No differences were observed between the height z-score, weight z-score, BMI z-score, age, and AHI. No association between obesity and OSAHS was found in this series. However, studies of larger, unselected populations are needed to determine if obesity is a risk factor for OSAHS in children."
Do adjustable vs set-pressure valves decrease the risk of proximal shunt obstruction in the treatment of pediatric hydrocephalus?,"In our experience, the use of programmable vales was associated with a decreased risk of proximal shunt obstruction and shunt revision. Programmable valves may be preferred in patients frequently experiencing proximal shunt failure. A prospective, controlled study is warranted to evaluate the potential value of adjustable vs set-pressure valve systems."
Is psoriasin ( S100A7 ) significantly up-regulated in human epithelial skin tumours?,"Similar to the findings in breast and bladder cancer, the up-regulation of psoriasin might play a role in the progression of skin cancer. The expression of psoriasin in human skin tumours seems to be independent from differentiation and inflammation."
Do topographic movie of ictal high-frequency oscillations on the brain surface using subdural EEG in neocortical epilepsy?,Topographic movies of intracranial HFOs on the brain surface allow visualization of the dynamic ictal changes in neocortical epilepsy.
Do prognostic factors for survival after stereotactic radiosurgery vary with the number of cerebral metastases?,The data from this study suggested that different factors affected survival in patients who had from 1 to 3 metastases and patients who had > or =4 metastases. Further research into this area may clarify causes for this discrepancy and improve prognostication.
Is endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( Glu298Asp ) polymorphism an independent risk factor for migraine with aura?,"Homozygous Asp298, a common variant of the eNOS gene, is an independent risk factor for MA in this study population."
Does vitamin D fortification of milk products resolve hypovitaminosis D in young Finnish men?,Vitamin D fortification of milk products slightly but insufficiently improved the poor vitamin D status of young Finnish men during winter. Further supplementation is warranted in order to normalize vitamin D levels and to support achievement of maximum peak bone mass.
Does insulin glargine improve glycemic control and health-related quality of life in type 1 diabetes?,The results of this study show that the beneficial effect of glargine is not limited to better metabolic control; the burden of type 1 diabetes mellitus on everyday life is also reduced.
Do in-vitro transport characteristics discriminate wild-type ABCB1 ( MDR1 ) from ALA893SER and ALA893THR polymorphisms?,"These results suggest an influence of ABCB1-893 triallelic variants on transport function and drug-drug interaction, which might be most pronounced in 893Thr. Furthermore, some of the mechanisms of 2677G/T/A-based haplotype-associated alterations in ABCB1 activity may have been unveiled."
"Do platelet count , mean platelet volume , platelet distribution width , and plateletcrit correlate with optical platelet aggregation responses in healthy volunteers?","As a result, we found no correlation between platelet aggregation responses obtained with optical method and platelet indices proposed as indicators of certain pathologic conditions, and it does not seem possible to use platelet indices as a direct indicator of platelet activation. In conditions where platelet functions should have been assessed, platelet indices alone are inappropriate and further evaluation is necessary with different methods."
Is osteoprotegerin associated with angiographic coronary calcification?,"Both calcified and non-calcified culprit plaques exhibited a similar inflammatory response to stent-mediated injury. After PCI, osteoprotegerin decreased while proinflammatory cytokines increased, which may be consistent with a counterregulatory role for osteoprotegerin."

Do mDR1 C3435T polymorphisms correlate with cyclosporine levels in de novo renal recipients?,"MDR1 SNPs are correlated with CsA exposure in the early post-transplant period. Polymorphisms, in conjunction with other criteria, may become a useful tool to optimize initial drug dosing in renal transplantation."
Is blastocyst embryo transfer associated with a sex-ratio imbalance in favor of male offspring?,"This is the first individual-center report of a significant sex-ratio imbalance after the sequential media culture of blastocysts. The large imbalance in singleton births associated with the use of donor oocytes, although not significant, is cautionary in regard to the use of elective single ETs. Observation and publication of phenomena such as the effects of extended culture on the sex ratio of live-borns will allow us a better understanding of early differences in sexual dimorphism of the embryo, and will allow us to counsel our patients more appropriately."
Does inhibition of aldose reductase prevent lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in human lens epithelial cells?,"The results indicate that AR mediates the bacterial endotoxin signaling that could damage HLECs by regulating the signals that activate the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-kappaB and cause inflammation. Thus, inhibition of AR could be a therapeutic target for Gram-negative bacterial infection-induced visual complications."
Are cNS progenitor cells and oligodendrocytes targets of chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo?,"Identifying neural populations at risk during any cancer treatment is of great importance in developing means of reducing neurotoxicity and preserving quality of life in long-term survivors. Thus, as well as providing possible explanations for the adverse neurological effects of systemic chemotherapy, the strong correlations between our in vitro and in vivo analyses indicate that the same approaches we used to identify the reported toxicities can also provide rapid in vitro screens for analyzing new therapies and discovering means of achieving selective protection or targeted killing."
Do steroids reduce local inflammatory mediator secretion and mucosal permeability in collagenous colitis patients?,"Oral steroid treatment in CC patients induced a simultaneous reduction of bowel movements and rectal release of ECP, bFGF, VEGF and albumin, suggesting that these polypeptides and increased mucosal permeability are important components of the pathophysiology in collagenous colitis."

Does interferon augment the anti-fibrotic activity of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in patients with refractory chronic hepatitis C?,The combination therapy of an ACE-I and IFN may have a diverse effect on disease progression in patients with CHC refractory to IFN therapy through its anti-fibrotic effect.
Are cis-motifs upstream of the transcription and translation initiation sites effectively revealed by their positional disequilibrium in eukaryote genomes using frequency distribution curves?,"This is the first study to reveal positional over-representation of CREs and promoter motifs in a cross-species approach. CREs and motifs shared between eukaryotic promoters support the observation that an eukaryotic promoter structure has been conserved throughout evolutionary time. Furthermore, with the information on positional enrichment of a motif or a known functional CRE, it is possible to get a more detailed insight into where an element appears to function. This in turn might accelerate the in depth examination of known and yet unknown cis-regulatory sequences in the laboratory."
Are fGFR1 and WT1 markers of human prostate cancer progression?,"Our results suggest that each of these four genes may play a role, or at least reflect a stage of prostate carcinoma growth/development/progression."
Do amnesia for electric dental pulp stimulation and picture recall test under different levels of propofol or midazolam sedation?,"Propofol and midazolam did not show any significant difference in amnesic effects to non-invasive stimuli. For invasive stimuli, midazolam showed a stronger amnesic effect at the moderate sedation level, but not at the deeper sedation level."
Is cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress affected by alpha2-adrenoreceptor activation or inhibition?,Cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress is not related to pharmacologically manipulated tonic central sympathetic nervous system activity by alpha2-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. These results do not support the assumption that cardiovascular reactivity is an index of tonic central sympathetic nervous system activity.

Is video-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy for lung cancer associated with less immunochemokine disturbances than thoracotomy?,"VATS major lung resection for NSCLC is associated with higher circulating levels of IGFBP-3, and lower levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1, compared to the thoracotomy approach. The clinical relevance of these postoperative changes on tumor biology following lung resection for cancer warrants further investigation."
Is executive dysfunction a significant predictor of poor quality of life in children with epilepsy?,"Executive dysfunction appears to exert a broad adverse influence on HRQOL in children with epilepsy, with clinical-level impairments in executive dysfunction contributing to a twofold increase in the likelihood of poor HRQOL. The constellation of executive dysfunction, low adaptive level, high medication load, and a history of several failed AEDs are risk factors for poor HRQOL in children with epilepsy."
Is higher maternal dietary protein intake in late pregnancy associated with a lower infant ponderal index at birth?,This raises the possibility that any effect of high protein in altering infant anthropometry at birth may involve changes in body composition and future work to examine how a high-protein diet influences body composition at birth is warranted.
Are sleep disorders underdiagnosed in patients on maintenance hemodialysis?,The patients on hemodialysis showed poor sleep quality with a significant increase in the apnea-hypopnea index and in the number of dips in SaO(2). SAHS was underdiagnosed in a large percentage of the hemodialysis patients.

Quantitative analysis of methylation levels is a promising risk marker for gastric cancers."
Is heavy daily smoking among under 18-year-old psychiatric inpatients associated with increased risk for suicide attempts?,"Among adolescents with severe psychiatric illnesses, heavy daily smoking may increase the risk of suicidal behaviour independently of current psychiatric diagnosis. The degree of nicotine dependence of an adolescent should therefore be carefully assessed as part of psychiatric evaluation."
Do leptin levels decline steadily during prolonged fasting in lean children?,"After 6 hours, leptin levels steadily decline during prolonged fasting in lean children. The decline probably is related to the suppression of insulin secretion. Although baseline leptin levels were related to BMI and age, in the final fasting sample, leptin levels showed minimal variation in this pediatric cohort encompassing a wide age range."
Does exposure to marijuana during pregnancy alter neurobehavior in the early neonatal period?,Marijuana exposure during pregnancy alters the neurobehavioral performance of term newborn infants of adolescent mothers.

Does genetic deficiency of cyclooxygenase-2 attenuate abdominal aortic aneurysm formation in mice?,Our findings suggest that increased COX-2 expression in smooth muscle cells of the abdominal aorta contributes to AAA formation in mice by enhancing inflammatory cell infiltration.
Does knee joint loading differ in individuals with mild compared with moderate medial knee osteoarthritis?,"The differences between mild and moderate symptomatic radiographic knee OA are not only structural but also functional, based on the magnitude of load in the medial knee joint. Moreover, knee adduction angular impulse provides additional information beyond that available from the peak knee adduction moment, and may therefore be an important gait parameter to include in OA research. These findings are important for our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of OA."
Do comparison of ThinPrep and Pap smear in relation to prediction of adenocarcinoma in situ?,"Even though in routine practice SSTP did not perform as well as PS in predicting AIS, it has the potential to do so. These results cannot anticipate the performance of direct-to-vial TP with respect to prediction of AIS."
Does misclassification and selection bias when identifying Alzheimer 's disease solely from Medicare claim records?,"Underclassification of dementia from claims records can be partially remedied by increasing the period during which claims are compiled, but additional diagnostic sources will likely be needed to increase prevalence counts closer to 100% of true cases. Risk adjustment based on a single year of reported claims expenditures may overpay providers, at least in the short term, because payment incentives will likely increase prevalence reporting."
Does inflammation enhance cardiovascular risk and mortality in hemodialysis patients?,"These results suggest that a considerable number of hemodialysis patients exhibit an activated acute phase response, which is closely related to high levels of atherogenic vascular risk factors and cardiovascular death. The mechanisms of activated acute phase reaction in patients on chronic hemodialysis remain to be identified. A successful treatment of the inflammatory condition may improve long-term survival in these patients."
Do umbilical vessels of preeclamptic women have low contents of both n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids?,"Low amounts of long-chain n-3 and n-6 PUFAs in umbilical vessels of preeclamptic women with adequate n-6 status may indicate insufficient transplacental transfer of long-chain PUFAs. The low amounts of 20:4n-6, high amounts of 20:3n-9, and high ratio of 20:3n-9 to 20:4n-6 in umbilical arteries may unfavorably affect local prostacyclin production. Low amounts of 20:3n-6 in umbilical arteries and veins and low amounts of 20:5n-3 in maternal platelets may contribute to the dominance of eicosanoids derived from 20:4n-6."

Are rate and breadth of protein evolution only weakly correlated?,"Rate and breadth are two distinct, and only weakly correlated, characteristics of protein evolution. The most likely explanation of their positive correlation is heterogeneity of selective constraint, such that less functionally important sites evolve faster and can accept more amino acids."
Is altered arm posture in children with cerebral palsy related to instability during walking?,"Children with CP appear to rely on 'guard' arm postures as a compensation strategy to maintain balance while walking comparable to newly walking toddlers. Importantly, this pattern is seen on the least affected side. The substantially altered arm posture on the most affected side in children with unilateral CP, however, suggests that spasticity and associated movements are also important contributing factors."
Does american Joint Committee on Cancer T category for eyelid sebaceous carcinoma correlate with nodal metastasis and survival?,"T category in the 7th edition of the AJCC TNM staging system for eyelid carcinoma correlates with outcomes in patients with sebaceous carcinoma of eyelid. On the basis of the present findings, it seems reasonable to recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy or at least strict regional lymph node surveillance for patients with eyelid sebaceous carcinoma with tumors of T category T2b or worse or 10 mm or more in greatest dimension."

Cilostazol may reduce the rate of disease progression in patients with asymptomatic ICS.
Do [ The specialist-referred patients represent 42 % of the activity of an academic memory clinic ]?,"As compared to non-SRP, SRP are younger, more demented (64,4%) and more prone to have non-AD dementia (69,9%). However, AD represented the most frequent diagnosis (19.4% of SRP)."
Are auditory verbal hallucinations in patients with borderline personality disorder similar to those in schizophrenia?,"AVH in BPD patients are phenomenologically similar to those in schizophrenia, and different from those in healthy individuals. As AVH in patients with BPD fulfil the criteria of hallucinations proper, we prefer the term AVH over 'pseudohallucinations', so as to prevent trivialization and to promote adequate diagnosis and treatment."
Does apoptosis of non-tumor cells contribute to increased serum cytochrome c level in a neuroblastoma xenograft model?,Increased concentration of Cyt c in the serum of tumor-bearing nude mice might be partially attributed to the secretion of this protein by non-tumor cells.
Does cTLA4-Ig relieve inflammation in murine models of coxsackievirus B3-induced myocarditis?,"T(H)1 cytokines were predominant in the acute phase of viral myocarditis. CTLA4-Ig relieves myocardial inflammation, virus replication, and mouse mortality, probably by influencing the balance of T(H)1 to T(H)2."
Is pINCH an independent prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients without preoperative radiotherapy -- a study in a Swedish rectal cancer trial of preoperative radiotherapy?,PINCH expression at the invasive margin was an independent prognostic factor in patients without RT. RT does not seem to directly affect the PINCH expression.

Do pilot study to develop and test a generic peer feedback instrument to review videotaped consultations in primary care?,"The results suggest that the instrument is useful only when applied to practitioners who have been taught how to consult in a patientcentred manner, and have led to the introduction of training in consultation skills for  pharmacists throughout Scotland. Potential reliability in providing peer feedback for GP consultations is important in the context of the provision of consistent, meaningful evidence for GP appraisal and revalidation in the UK."
Are polymorphisms in the maternal sex steroid pathway associated with behavior problems in male offspring?,We observed maladaptive behaviors in the male offspring of mothers who carried functional polymorphisms in the sex steroid pathway. The strongest associations were in domains commonly affected in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.
Is in vitro fertilization a successful treatment in endometriosis-associated infertility?,"With the exception of patients with endometrioma, infertile women with various stages of endometriosis have the same success rates with IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection as patients with tubal factor. This contrasts with the systematic review on which the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology bases its recommendations."
Does oral alcohol administration disturb tear film and ocular surface?,Orally administered ethanol was secreted into the tears. Ethanol in tears induced tear hyperosmolarity and shortened TBUT and triggered the development of ocular surface diseases. Similar changes could exacerbate signs and symptoms in patients with ocular surface disease.
Is the release of S-100B and NSE in severe traumatic head injury associated with APOE ε4?,"Our data indicate that there might be a gene-induced susceptibility to severe traumatic brain injury and that patients with the APOE ε4 allele may be more predisposed to brain cellular damage measured as S-100B and NSE. Thus, it seems to be of importance to consider the APOE genotype in interpreting the levels of the biomarkers."
Do depressive symptoms in mild cognitive impairment predict greater atrophy in Alzheimer 's disease-related regions?,"Depressive symptoms were associated with greater atrophy in AD-affected regions, increased cognitive decline, and higher rates of conversion to AD. Depression in individuals with MCI may be associated with underlying neuropathological changes, including prodromal AD, and may be a potentially useful clinical marker in identifying MCI patients who are most likely to progress to AD."
Is arrival by ambulance associated with acute stroke intervention in young adults?,Young adults with stroke symptoms were more likely to receive acute stroke intervention if they arrived by ambulance. Larger multi-center studies should address whether Primary Stroke Centers are more likely to provide either IV thrombolysis or interventional therapies in young patients with acute ischemic stroke.
Is bRAF mutation a prognostic biomarker for colorectal liver metastasectomy?,BRAF mutation is an independent prognostic biomarker for colorectal liver metastasectomy.
Does advanced glycation end-products inhibition improve endothelial dysfunction in rheumatoid arthritis?,"Advanced glycation end products inhibitor improves endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory disease activity in RA. In RA, endothelial dysfunction is part of the disease process and is mediated by AGEs-induced inflammation."
Are urine sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 levels elevated in lupus nephritis?,"Urinary sVCAM-1 may serve as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of lupus nephritis as levels correlated with even mild abnormalities of urine sediment. In addition, both urine sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 levels may be useful in identifying patients at risk of lupus nephritis."
Are tumor epidermal growth factor receptor and EGFR PY1068 independent prognostic indicators for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma?,"In two independent HNSCC cohorts treated with or without cetuximab, tumor EGFR levels were indicative of survival. Tumor EGFR PY1068 levels provided prognostic information independent of total EGFR."
Does rAF265 inhibit the growth of advanced human melanoma tumors?,Orthotopic implants of patient tumors in mice may predict prognosis and treatment response for melanoma patients. A subpopulation of human melanoma tumors responds to RAF265 and can be characterized by gene mutation and gene expression profiles.
Is chromogranin A a reliable biomarker for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in an Asian population of patients?,The plasma CgA level is a reliable biomarker for GEP-NET. We conclude that changes in CgA levels are associated with disease status and treatment responses.

Do assessment of cochlear implant candidacy in patients with cochlear nerve deficiency using the P1 CAEP biomarker?,"Although cochlear implantation in children is a fairly routine procedure, cases exist for which implant candidacy is questionable. Among these cases are children with CND. In these children, cochlear implantation may be contraindicated  due to the likelihood that the implant electrodes may not stimulate the VIII nerve adequately. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the gold standard in the assessment of CND, but this measure is not always sufficient to determine CI candidacy in cases of CND. The addition of the  P1 CAEP measurement to the usual electrophysiological, audiometric, and radiological test battery may prove to be useful in determining CI options for children with CND."
Is cT angiography of the aorta superior to transesophageal echocardiography for determining stroke subtypes in patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke?,CTA identifies more plaques throughout the aortic arch and around the origins of the major cerebral arteries in particular compared to TEE. These may represent potential embolic sources of acute ischemic stroke. Better plaque detection may have an impact on the best available secondary prevention regimen in individual patients if proximal embolic sources are suspected.
Is influenza-associated illness an important contributor to febrile convulsions in Danish children?,"Influenza like illness is associated with a considerable burden of febrile convulsions in children, most pronounced in years with epidemics.

Does admission serum lactate predict mortality in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?,"In aneurysmal SAH, elevated serum lactate levels on admission may have a predictive role for mortality and represent a marker of disease severity. Currently, lactic acid levels are not ordered on all patients with SAH but perhaps should be part of the routine initial blood work and may serve as an additional prognostic marker."
Does ruboxistaurin attenuate diabetic nephropathy via modulation of TGF-β1/Smad and GRAP pathways?,These data suggest that the renoprotective effect of ruboxistaurin is possibly due to down-regulation of TGF-β1/Smad pathway and normalization of GRAP protein expression.
Do enhanceosome transcription factors preferentially dimerize with high mobility group proteins?,"It follows from our experiments that, except for homodimer formed by IRF proteins, the rest of the dimers were formed exclusively between one of the transcriptional activators (ATF-2/c-Jun and IRF) and a HMG I protein. NF- κB did not participate in forming dimers with other proteins. Dimers predicted in mouse were fully contained in those predicted in human, with exactly the same spacing and orientation. Intriguingly, in most of the cases the enhanceosome motifs have 1 bp wider spacing than the corresponding dimers predicted genome-wide, which is likely caused by the overall 3D structure constraints of the enhanceosome-bound complex."
Are non-responders in a quitline evaluation more likely to be smokers - a drop-out and long-term follow-up study of the Swedish National Tobacco Quitline?,Non-responders to a 12-month follow-up smoking cessation questionnaire in a quitline setting were more likely to be smokers 1.5-3 years later.

Xase complexes formed with either molecule exhibited similar kinetic profiles for factor Xa generation. In acute efficacy models, mice infused with rFIXFc or rFIX were equally protected from bleeding. However, in prophylactic efficacy models, protection from bleeding was maintained approximately three times longer in rFIXFc-dosed mice than in those given rFIX; this prolonged efficacy correlates with the previously observed half-life extension. We conclude that rFIXFc retains critical FIX procoagulant attributes and that the extension in rFIXFc half-life translates into prolonged efficacy in hemophilia B mice."
Does preoperative Aspects and Dimensions Used for Anatomical Score predict Treatment Failures in Laparoscopic Cryoablation of Small Renal Masses?,The PADUA score significantly predicts residual unablated tumor and DFS following LCA.

We also provide for the first time gene interaction pathways in AIS pathogenesis. These genes are involved in various bone regulatory and developmental pathways and many of them can be grouped into clusters to participate in a particular biological pathway. Further studies can be built on our findings to further elucidate the association between different biological pathways and the pathogenesis of AIS.
Is common docking domain mutation E322K of the ERK2 gene infrequent in oral squamous cell carcinomas?,"Our result indicates that mutation in the CD domain of ERK2 is rare in OSCC patients, which suggests the role of genetic alterations in other mitogenic genes in the development of carcinoma in the rest of the patients. Nevertheless, the finding is clinically significant, as the relatively rare prevalence of the E322K mutation in OSCC suggests that ERK2, being a common end point signal in the multi-hierarchical mitogen activated signaling pathway may be explored as a viable drug target in the treatment of OSCC."
Does kRAS mutation predict the efficacy of neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer : a systematic review and meta-analysis?,"Based on these data, the presence of KRAS mutation does not affect tumor down-staging or cancer specific survival following neo-adjuvant CRT and surgery for rectal cancer."

The results reiterate the recommendation that every effort should be made to follow all patients up after joint replacement. This will improve the accuracy of survival reporting and assist comparison between different prostheses.
Is chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps characterized by B-cell inflammation and EBV-induced protein 2 expression?,"B cells and plasma cells are enriched in NPs, actively produce antibodies locally, and might contribute to chronic inflammation in patients with CRS. Elucidating the mechanisms that underlie this excessive local B-cell response might provide novel insights for the development of improved therapeutic strategies."
Is the iron status of children and youth in a community mental health clinic lower than that of a national sample?,"The ferritin levels of children and youth in a mental health clinic sample were significantly lower than those of the same-aged subjects in a national sample. Therefore, compromised iron status may be an additional biological risk factor for cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric problems in pediatric populations served by the community mental health clinic."
Is long-term administration of intranasal oxytocin a safe and promising therapy for early adolescent boys with autism spectrum disorders?,"Although our results on the efficacy of long-term nasal OT therapy still remain controversial, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report documenting the safety of long-term nasal OT therapy for children with ASD. Even though our data are too preliminary to draw any definite conclusions about efficacy, they do suggest this therapy to be safe, promising, and worthy of a large-scale, double-blind placebo-controlled study."
"Is phonosurgery of vocal fold polyps , cysts and nodules beneficial?",PS is a quick and effective treatment with uncommon and transient post-operative complications. Objective assessment of the voice pre- and post-operatively should be used consistently and applied in controlled studies evaluating the additional impact of pre- and post-operative voice therapy.

Liraglutide protected INS-1 cells from high glucose level-induced apoptosis that is accompanied by a significant increase of autophagy, suggesting that liraglutide plays a role in beta cell apoptosis by targeting autophagy. Thus, autophagy may be a new target for the prevention or treatment of diabetes."
Do motor and gait improvement in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury induced by high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation?,"High-frequency rTMS over the leg motor area can improve LEMS, spasticity, and gait in patients with motor incomplete SCI."
Does anodal tDCS applied during strength training enhance motor cortical plasticity?,"The application of a-tDCS in combination with strength training of the wrist extensors in a healthy population did not provide additional benefit for voluntary dynamic strength gains when compared with standard strength training. However, strength training with a-tDCS appears to differentially modulate cortical plasticity via increases in corticospinal excitability and decreases in SICI, which did not occur following strength training alone."
Does intervention in overweight children improve body mass index ( BMI ) and physical activity?,"The innovative approach used in this study demonstrated modest efficacy in reducing BMI z score, changing physical activity levels, and possibly shifting family dynamics."
Does tumor volume successively reflect the state of disease progression in endometrial cancer?,Tumor volume successively reflects the state of disease progression in endometrial cancer. The volume index can give information on both the staged prognosis and surgical management.

Does socio-economic status play important roles in childhood cancer treatment outcome in Indonesia?,Treatment abandonment was most important reason for treatment failure. Treatment outcome was determined by parental socio-economic status. Childhood cancer survival could improve if financial constraints and provision of information and guidance are better addressed.
Is ketamine associated with lower urinary tract signs and symptoms?,"Compared to non-users, recent ketamine users had increased odds of LUTS. This is the first large-scale community-based study assessing the association of non-medical ketamine use with LUTS. Associations between ketamine and urological symptoms should be confirmed through longitudinal studies."
Are sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass equally effective in correcting insulin resistance?,Both surgical techniques are equally effective in achieving insulin resistance normalization in the majority of severely obese patients. Three-month HOMA-IR reduction after surgery was the main predictor of T2DM complete remission.
Does ethosuximide reduce epileptogenesis and behavioral comorbidity in the GAERS model of genetic generalized epilepsy?,"Chronic ESX treatment has disease-modifying effects in the GAERS model of GGE, with antiepileptogenic effects against absence seizures and mitigation of behavioral comorbidities. The cellular mechanism for these effects may involve epigenetic modifications."

Is plaque stabilization by intensive LDL-cholesterol lowering therapy with atorvastatin delayed in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease-Serial angioscopic and intravascular ultrasound analysis?,"In DM patients, plaque volume regression by atorvastatin was shown to be attenuated, and its color improvement was significantly delayed. However, the yellowness became comparable between DM and nDM groups at week 80. These results indicate that patients with DM should be treated by intensive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin for at least 80 weeks to stabilize vulnerable plaque."
Are preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and tumor histologic grade associated with surgical detection of the sentinel lymph node?,The probability of not detecting the sentinel lymph node during the surgical intervention is higher in patients with high histologic grade tumors or in patients in whom preoperative lymphoscintigraphy failed to detect the sentinel node.
Does imipramine treatment increase cell proliferation following fluid percussion brain injury in rats?,"Longer duration of treatment with imipramine promotes sustained increase in hippocampal cell proliferation and survival. Global neurogenesis corresponds to the diffuse nature of FPI injury. Cognitive outcome can be due to a delay in our behavior testing as much as an absence of cognitive benefit of imipramine at this stage of neurogenesis. Nevertheless, exploring the potential benefits of prophylactic antidepressant treatment in human TBI patients is worthwhile."
Does transplantation of differentiated bone marrow stromal cells promote motor functional recovery in rats with stroke?,BDNF-MSCs might contribute to the motor function improvement partly by reducing neuronal damage via upregulating the NSE expression level and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis.
Is medial sixth of the patellar tendon at the tibial attachment useful for the anterior reference in rotational alignment of the tibial component?,"The AP axis of the tibia is useful as a tibial rotational reference in cutting the proximal tibia, but it is difficult to identify the AP axis after tibial resection. The clinical relevance of this study is that medial 1/6 of the patellar tendon at its attachment would be a useful landmark in aligning the tibial component."
Do intervertebral anticollision constraints improve out-of-plane translation accuracy of a single-plane fluoroscopy-to-CT registration method for measuring spinal motion?,"The proposed single-plane fluoroscopy-to-CT registration method reduced the out-of-plane translation errors for intervertebral kinematic measurements while keeping the measurement accuracies for the other five DOF more or less unaltered. With the submillimeter and subdegree accuracy, the WEMAC method was considered accurate for measuring 3D intervertebral kinematics during various functional activities for research and clinical applications."
Are higher levels of physical activity associated with lower hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis reactivity to psychosocial stress in children?,These results suggest that children with lower levels of daytime PA have higher HPAA activity in response to stress. These findings may offer insight into the pathways of PA on physical and mental well-being.

Further studies are necessary to determine the causative nature of this association and how various factors related to sports participation may contribute."
Does carotid plaque hemorrhage on magnetic resonance imaging strongly predict recurrent ischemia and stroke?,"MRIPH independently and strongly predicts recurrent ipsilateral ischemic events, and stroke alone, in symptomatic ≥ 50% carotid artery stenosis. The very low stroke risk in patients without MRIPH puts into question current risk-benefit assessment for CEA in this subgroup."
Does real-time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography add value to transcatheter aortic valve implantation?,"A systematic, comprehensive echocardiographic protocol, incorporating the additional benefits of 3D TEE, has a vital role within a TAVI program and, combined with a 3D THV sizing strategy, contributes to excellent outcomes."
Does the Mediterranean diet improve hepatic steatosis and insulin sensitivity in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?,"Even without weight loss, MD reduces liver steatosis and improves insulin sensitivity in an insulin-resistant population with NAFLD, compared to current dietary advice. This diet should be further investigated in subjects with NAFLD."

Are anti-TNF antibody-induced psoriasiform skin lesions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease characterised by interferon-γ-expressing Th1 cells and IL-17A/IL-22-expressing Th17 cells and respond to anti-IL-12/IL-23 antibody treatment?,New onset psoriasiform skin lesions develop in nearly 5% of anti-TNF-treated patients with IBD. We identified smoking as a main risk factor for developing these lesions. Anti-TNF-induced psoriasiform skin lesions are characterised by Th17 and Th1 cell infiltrates. The number of IL-17A-expressing T cells correlates with the severity of skin lesions. Anti-IL-12/IL-23 antibody therapy is a highly effective therapy for these lesions.
Do genetic predisposition and environmental danger signals initiate chronic autoimmune hepatitis driven by CD4+ T cells?,"We developed a new murine AIH model closely resembling AIH in patients that explains the mechanisms of AIH pathophysiology. In addition, emAIH provides options to test therapeutic alternatives for patients not achieving remission, with reduced side effects of chronic nonspecific immunosuppression."
Do high incidence of mild hyponatraemia in females using ecstasy at a rave party?,"Only 3% of males, but no less than ∼25% of females attending a rave party and using MDMA developed mild hyponatraemia during the event. Especially females are therefore probably also at risk of developing severe symptomatic hyponatraemia. Not using MDMA is obviously the best option to prevent MDMA-induced hyponatraemia. However, accepting the fact that millions use the drug every weekend, strategies should also be developed to prevent hyponatraemia in subjects choosing to take MDMA. This would include matching the electrolyte content of the fluids and food ingested to that of the fluids that are lost during the use of MDMA, mainly by perspiration. Users of MDMA and emergency health care workers should become more aware of the relatively high incidence of MDMA-induced hyponatraemia and of potential strategies to prevent this complication."
Does preoperative magnetic resonance spectroscopy improve diagnostic accuracy in a series of neurosurgical dilemmas?,"Our study supports a beneficial role for (1)H MRS in certain diagnostic intracranial dilemmas presenting to neurosurgeons. The information gleaned from preoperative (1)H MRS can be a useful adjunct to clinical and conventional MR imaging data in guiding the management of patients with intracranial pathologies, particularly high-grade tumour versus abscess, and high-grade versus low-grade glioma. Further larger prospective studies are needed to clearly define the utility of (1)H MRS in diagnostically challenging intracranial lesions in neurosurgery."
Are focal adhesion dynamics altered in schizophrenia?,The evidence for altered motility and focal adhesion dynamics in patient-derived cells is consistent with dysregulated gene expression in the FAK signaling pathway in these cells. Alterations in cell adhesion dynamics and cell motility could bias the trajectory of brain development in schizophrenia.

Is prognosis deteriorating for upper tract urothelial cancer : data for England 1985-2010?,"Despite sharing its risk factors with bladder cancer, current incidence and mortality trends for UTUC contrast with those in bladder cancer. Increasing use of cross-sectional imaging may explain some of the identified increased incidence. Higher incidence specifically in people >80 years, together with stage migration to more advanced cancers, are likely to have caused at least some of the observed increased mortality. Further study is required to answer the questions of whether there are other hitherto unidentified aetiological or prognostic factors; whether less aggressive treatment of UTUCs in the elderly is always justified; and whether the rising frequency of minimally invasive treatment means suboptimum oncological management."
Does expression of novel carotenoid biosynthesis genes from Enterococcus gilvus improve the multistress tolerance of Lactococcus lactis?,The expression of carotenoid biosynthesis genes from Ent. gilvus improves the multistress tolerance of L. lactis.
Does occlusal plane canting reduction accompany mandibular counterclockwise rotation in camouflaging treatment of hyperdivergent skeletal Class II malocclusion?,"Increased OP canting with overerupted incisors is evident in the hyperdivergent skeletal Class II malocclusion. During the camouflaging treatment, reduction of OP canting could occur. It was accompanied by mandibular counterclockwise rotation and intrusion of the maxillary incisor."
Is subgenual anterior cingulate cortex activity covariation with cardiac vagal control altered in depression?,"Findings in healthy volunteers suggest that sgACC participates in affective state shifting. The latter function appears to be altered in depressed individuals, and may have implications for the unvarying mood and vagal dysfunction associated with depression."
Are lA volumes and reservoir function associated with subclinical cerebrovascular disease : the CABL ( Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions ) study?,"Greater LA volumes and reduced LA reservoir function are associated with subclinical cerebrovascular disease detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging in subjects without history of stroke. In particular, LAV(min) and LAEF are more strongly associated with SBI and WMHV than the more commonly measured LAVmax, and their relationship with subclinical brain lesions is independent of other cardiovascular risk factors."
Does a GPR18-based signalling system regulate IOP in murine eye?,"We present evidence for a functional GPR18-based signalling system in the murine anterior eye, including receptors and ligands. GPR18 agonists, Abn-CBD and NAGly, reduce IOP independently of CB₁, CB₂ or GPR55. These findings suggest that GPR18 may serve as a desirable target for the development of novel ocular hypotensive medications."
Is spontaneous osteoarthritis in Str/ort mice unlikely due to greater vulnerability to mechanical trauma?,"Genetic OA susceptibility in Str/ort mice is not apparently related to greater AC vulnerability to trauma, but joint loading modifies severity of natural OA lesions in the medial tibia. FE modelling suggests that thicker AC in Str/ort mice diminishes tissue stresses and protects against load-induced AC lesions in the LF but that this is unrelated to their genetic susceptibility to OA."
Is bRAF mutation positive papillary thyroid carcinoma less advanced when Hashimoto 's thyroiditis lymphocytic infiltration is present?,"These results suggest that lymphocytic infiltration of HT is a protective factor against PTC progression, and it is independent of BRAF mutational status."
Do cirrhosis histology and Laennec staging system correlate with high portal pressure?,"Histological subclassification of cirrhosis, collagen in the space of Disse and micronodularity are independent predictors of high portal pressure. The Laennec histological subclassification of cirrhosis correlates well with clinical severity of cirrhosis, and can provide useful prognostic information."

Does cortical somatosensory processing measured by magnetoencephalography predict neurodevelopment in extremely low-gestational-age infants?,"Abnormal SII responses at term predict adverse neuromotor development at 2 y of corrected age. This adverse development may not be foreseen with conventional neuroimaging methods, suggesting a role for evaluating SII responses in the developmental risk assessment of ELGA infants."
Does sCIRehab used practice-based evidence methodology to associate patient and treatment characteristics with outcomes?,"The application of PBE methodology in the SCIRehab study provided extensive information about the process of inpatient SCI rehabilitation. While patient demographic and injury characteristics explain substantial variation in rehabilitation outcomes, particularly functional outcomes, significant relations also were found between the type and quantity of treatment interventions delivered by each rehabilitation discipline and a broad range of outcomes."
Do noninvasive fibrosis indices predict intrahepatic distant recurrence of hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma following radiofrequency ablation?,"High levels of AFP and API predict IDR of HBV-related HCC after RFA. Therefore, noninvasive fibrosis indices could play an important role in predicting IDR of HCC following percutaneous ablation."
Is selenium inversely associated with interleukin-6 in the elderly?,Serum selenium was inversely associated with inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 among elderly living in long-term care facilities in Taiwan. Monitoring serum selenium should be considered in these institutionalized elderly.

Is myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) superior to the demonstration of distal collaterals in predicting cardiac events in chronic total occlusion ( CTO )?,MPI in patients with CTO accurately predicted HCE. This allows for accurate triage of patients by MPI for consideration of revascularization. Patients without ischemia can be safely managed with optimal medical therapy. The presence of collateralization did not predict either ischemia or HCE.
Is neurodegeneration in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats attenuated by treatment with resveratrol?,These observations suggest that Rsv significantly attenuated neurodegeneration and astrocytic activation in the hippocampus of diabetic rats. Our results suggested that Rsv could potentially be a new therapeutic agent for diabetic encephalopathy and neurodegeneration.

Is coronary artery and thoracic aorta calcification inversely related to coronary flow reserve as measured by ⁸²Rb PET/CT in intermediate risk patients?,"Combination of MPI, CFR, CAC, and TAC has complementary roles in intermediate risk patients."
"Is perioperative mortality and morbidity prediction using POSSUM , P-POSSUM and APACHE II in Chinese gastric cancer patients : surgical method a key independent factor affecting prognosis?","The utility of the APACHE II score in gastric cancer patients is limited. APACHE II is suitable for considering group versus individual effect. The POSSUM score is useful in general surgery, but needs improvement. We found the P-POSSUM score to be superior for morbidity and mortality prediction. P-POSSUM is useful for both the general population and for a specific cohort. The type of surgery is a key decision point for surgeons, and independently affects prognosis. Based upon these findings and clinical scoring systems, clinicians can develop individualized treatment algorithms."
Does breathing exercise using a new breathing device increase airway secretion clearance in mechanically ventilated patients?,Breathing exercise with a device that includes vibration and humidification of inspired air is effective for increasing secretion clearance with patients dependent on mechanical ventilation and was without any adverse effects.
Does uridine triphosphate increase proliferation of human cancerous pancreatic duct epithelial cells by activating P2Y2 receptor?,Uridine triphosphate increases proliferation of human pancreatic duct epithelial cells by activation of P2Y2 receptor and PI3K/Akt pathway. This could be helpful for discovering the long-term roles of P2Y2 receptor in pancreatic cells.
Is mind-to-paper an effective method for scientific writing?,"Mind-to-paper dictation for scientific writing is an effective method for production of scientific papers of good initial quality, even when used for the first time by inexperienced scientists. We conclude that practicing this concept produces papers of an adequate language complexity, and that dictation as a writing tool allows for fast transfer of ideas and thoughts to written text."
Does adolescent pain catastrophizing mediate the relationship between protective parental responses to pain and disability over time?,"Parental protectiveness is associated with disability indirectly through pain catastrophizing at the initial visit and follow-up. Decreases in parent protectiveness, potentially initiated through the initial evaluation, were related to lower levels of disability at follow-up through pain catastrophizing."
Is total blood volume of Asian patients undergoing cardiac surgery far from that predicted by conventional methods?,"Total blood volume of Asian patients calculated by the authors differs markedly from that estimated by Nadler and classic reference book formulas, which suggests that more accurate calculation of TBV is needed for Asian cardiac patients requiring CPB, especially patients with valvular disease."
Are thymidylate synthase and folyl-polyglutamate synthase clinically useful markers of response to pemetrexed in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma?,"Although previous retrospective data suggest that TS and FPGS expression might be potential markers of Pem efficacy in MPM, our data indicate these markers lack sufficient predictive value in individual patients and should not be used to guide therapeutic decisions in the absence of prospective studies."
Is long duration of hyperglycemia in the first 96 hours of life associated with severe intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants?,"Longer duration of hyperglycemia in the first 96 hours of life was most strongly associated with severe IVH in preterm infants. Consequently, interventional studies to determine the selective effect of continuous control of long-lasting hyperglycemia by appropriate and timed insulin treatment on the incidence of severe IVH are warranted."

Are morphometrics and lesions of vertebral end plates associated with lumbar disc degeneration : evidence from cadaveric spines?,"Vertebral end plate lesions were common and were associated with adjacent disc degeneration, with greater lesion size being associated with more severe disc degeneration. End plate morphometrics, particularly greater end plate size, may also play a role in the pathogenesis of disc degeneration."
Is ki-67 an independent predictor of metastasis and cause-specific mortality for prostate cancer patients treated on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 94-08?,"High Ki67-SI independently predicts for increased DSM, DM, and protocol BF in primarily intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with RT with or without ADT on RTOG 94-08 but does not predict for local recurrence or for increased relative benefit from ADT. This and prior studies lend support for the use of Ki67-SI as a stratification factor in future trials."
"Is when Crohn 's disease in remission , more patients complete capsule endoscopy study but less lesions are identified?","(1) A high percentage of patients with active CD do not complete small bowel study with WCE. (2) Small bowel ulcerative lesions in clinical remission were less severe, although at least 6 months are needed in order for them to disappear."

Is expression of miR-126 and miR-508-5p in endothelial progenitor cells associated with the prognosis of chronic heart failure patients?,"The miRNAs miR-126 and miR-508-5p are associated with the outcome of ICM and NICM patients with CHF. These two miRNAs could be useful in the diagnosis of CHF patients, and might provide novel targets for prevention and treatment of CHF."
"Is sense of coherence , rather than exercise capacity , the stronger predictor to obtain health-related quality of life in adults with congenital heart disease?","Adults with CHD have an enhanced SOC. SOC is moderately correlated with quality of life, and seems to be a stronger predictor of health-related life quality than exercise capacity. SOC might explain the rather good quality of life in patients with CHD despite their reduction in exercise capacity."
Does zinc finger protein A20 inhibit maturation of dendritic cells resident in rat liver allograft?,These data suggest that A20 overexpression could effectively inhibit maturation of DCs resident in liver allograft and consequently suppress acute liver allograft rejection.
Is cortical thinning associated with disease stages and dementia in Parkinson 's disease?,"We conclude that measuring cortical thickness can be useful in assessing disease stage and cognitive impairment in patients with PD. In addition, cortical thickness may be useful in identifying dementia in PD."
Does single session of dual-tDCS transiently improve precision grip and dexterity of the paretic hand after stroke?,One bout of dual-tDCS improved the motor control of precision grip and digital dexterity beyond the time of stimulation. These results suggest that dual-tDCS should be tested in longer protocols for neurorehabilitation and with moderate to severely impaired patients. The precise timing of stimulation after stroke onset and associated training should be defined.
Does four-dimensional geometric assessment of tricuspid annulus movement in early functional tricuspid regurgitation patients indicate decreased longitudinal flexibility?,"The longitudinal flexibility of the TA in FTR patients was significantly less than that in the healthy subjects, and the tethering of the tricuspid leaflets occurred in FTR patients despite the absence of TA and RV dilation, which can be one triggering factor of early FTR. Four-dimensional geometric assessment, using cardiac MRI and the tracking program that we have developed, is capable of determining TA structure and flexibility."
Are epicardial adipose tissue volume and adipocytokine imbalance strongly linked to human coronary atherosclerosis?,EATV and macrophage and cytokine/adipocytokine signals in EAT strongly correlated with CAD. Our findings suggest that EATV and adipocytokine imbalance are strongly linked to human coronary atherosclerosis.
Are both the cutaneous sensation and phosphene perception modulated in a frequency-specific manner during transcranial alternating current stimulation?,"We believe that our results provide a relevant insight into the procedural sensations caused by oscillatory currents, and will offer a basis for developing more sophisticated stimulation protocols and study designs for future investigations."
Does iCAM-1 expression predispose ocular tissues to immune-based inflammation in dry eye patients and Sjögrens syndrome-like MRL/lpr mice?,"Our findings suggest that ICAM-1 upregulation locally and systemically promote lymphocyte activation and migration to the ocular surface (OS). Ocular resident epithelium is an active component of ocular surface and is capable of interacting with invasive lymphocytes by ICAM-1 production in response to immune activation and inflammation. ICAM-1 synthesized by epithelial cells may serve as a signaling molecule for predisposition of ocular surface inflammation and facilitate potential antigen presentation by epithelial cells. Lymphocytic infiltrates in the lacrimal gland of the MRL/lpr mouse appeared to be the result of the accumulation, but not proliferation of circulating lymphocytes diapodesed from the vasculature that had migrated into the local ocular tissues. The potential use of anti-ICAM-1 therapy in treating immune-based inflammatory diseases such as dry eye deserves further investigation."
Does cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor treatment improve left ventricular function and mortality in a murine model of doxorubicin-induced heart failure?,COX-2 inhibitors can attenuate the progression of heart failure in a murine model of doxorubicin-induced heart failure.
Do hepatitis B genotypes correlate with tumor recurrence after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma?,Our data suggest that patients with HCC with genotype C have a greater tumor recurrence rate after curative resection of HCC compared with those with genotype B. Prolonged follow-up is needed to clarify the impact of HBV genotype on postoperative outcome.
Is noninvasive estimation of left ventricular filling pressure by E/e ' a powerful predictor of survival after acute myocardial infarction?,"E/e' is a powerful predictor of survival after acute MI. An E/e' ratio >15 is superior, in this respect, to other clinical or echocardiographic features. Furthermore, it provides prognostic information incremental to these parameters."
Do matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expressions correlate with the recurrence of intracranial meningiomas?,"Our study indicated that MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions are prognostic factors predicting the recurrence of meningioma, independent of proliferative potential."
Does atorvastatin affect the antiplatelet potency of clopidogrel when it is administered concomitantly for 5 weeks in patients with acute coronary syndromes?,Atorvastatin does not affect the antiplatelet potency of clopidogrel when coadministered for 5 weeks in ACS patients.
Are hLA-DQA1 and DQB1 alleles associated with genetic susceptibility to psoriasis vulgaris in Chinese Han?,HLA-DQA1*0104 and DQA1*0201 alleles may be psoriasis susceptibility genes or may be in close linkage with the susceptibility genes. The HLA-DQA1*0501 allele seems to have a protective effect against the development of psoriasis vulgaris in Chinese Han. There may be a difference in genetic background between psoriasis patients with and without a family history of psoriasis.
Does polymorphism of interleukin-1beta affect the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori by triple therapy?,"IL-1beta-511 polymorphism is one of the determinants of successful eradication of H. pylori using triple therapy with a PPI, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin, together with CYP2C19 genotype and bacterial resistance to clarithromycin."
Does ultrasound perfusion imaging in acute middle cerebral artery infarction predict outcome?,"In the early phase of acute ischemic stroke, BHI after SonoVue bolus injection is a useful ultrasound tool for analyzing cerebral perfusion deficits at the patient's bedside. BHI data correlate with the definite area of infarction and outcome after 4 months."
Are spikes on the postoperative EEG related to preoperative spike frequency and postoperative seizures?,We hypothesize that two factors independently influence the presence of postoperative spikes: chronic interictal disturbance (represented as preoperative spike frequency) and the acute (postoperative) seizures. Our study confirmed that persistent postoperative IED had a prognostic value regarding the outcome of the epilepsy surgery.
Does low mechanical index contrast-enhanced ultrasound better reflect high arterial perfusion of liver metastases than arterial phase computed tomography?,"Contrast-enhanced CT may not be able to visualize short-lasting but large differences of the arterial perfusion of liver metastases, as does contrast-enhanced low-MI ultrasound. This offers new methods for their characterization and for monitoring of therapeutic effects."
Are respiratory changes in inferior vena cava diameter helpful in predicting fluid responsiveness in ventilated septic patients?,Our study suggests that respiratory change in IVC diameter is an accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness in septic patients.
Do myocardial inflammatory responses to sepsis complicated by previous burn injury?,"A previous burn injury alters myocardial inflammatory responses, predisposing the burn-injured subject to exaggerated inflammation, which correlates with greater myocardial dysfunction."
Do intraoperative neurophysiologic discovery of uncrossed sensory and motor pathways in a patient with horizontal gaze palsy and scoliosis?,The results indicate uncrossed dorsal column-medial lemniscal and corticospinal pathways due to brain-stem malformation with absent internal arcuate and pyramidal decussations.
Do [ Determination of danshensu in rat serum after oral administer compound Salvia recipe ]?,Danshensu can be absorbed into blood after ig compound Salvia recipe.

Do human adipose tissue-derived cells delay re-epithelialization in comparison with skin fibroblasts in organotypic skin culture?,The possibility of generating HSEs with different cell types represents an attractive approach for in vitro studies focusing on the mechanism of wound healing.
Is human PRMT5 expression enhanced during in vitro tubule formation and after in vivo ischemic injury in renal epithelial cells?,"The role of PRMT5 in the regulation of mitosis, its induction in renal epithelial cells undergoing tubule formation in vitro and its expression in the tubules of the kidneys subjected to IRI suggest that it functions in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation during tubule formation and regeneration."
Does re-hospitalization after diagnosis of diabetes vary by gender and socioeconomic status in urban African-American and Latino young people?,"About 60% of respondents were re-hospitalized at least once for diabetes-related reasons (n = 128). Half of those questioned had Medicaid or no health insurance at all; 23% fit criteria for a non-autoimmune, type 2 diabetic phenotype. Those who avoided re-hospitalization were more likely to have been seen initially at a tertiary care facility, to have private health insurance, and to be males. They had, on average, 2 yr shorter duration of diabetes at the time of interview. Risk for re-hospitalization was not associated with age at diagnosis, ethnicity, diabetic phenotype, or source of care during the past year. In multivariate analysis, predictors of re-hospitalization were gender [odds ratio (OR) 1.98 for females vs. males (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-3.72)], duration of diabetes [OR = 1.46 per yr (95% CI = 1.36-1.57)], initial ascertainment at a community hospital [OR = 5.44 vs. tertiary care facility (95% CI = 2.61-11.29)] and having Medicaid or no insurance [OR = 2.73 (95% CI = 1.42-5.24)], compared with those with another type of health insurance. There is a high risk of re-hospitalization after the initial diagnosis of diabetes among insulin-treated minority children, particularly the uninsured and those on Medicaid, in part related to duration of disease and where the initial treatment occurred."
Does gene expression profiling identify platelet-derived growth factor as a diagnostic molecular marker for papillary thyroid carcinoma?,Platelet-derived growth factor may be a potential biomarker for PTC and follicular carcinoma. Expression profile analysis using a microarray followed by immunohistochemical study can be used to facilitate the development of molecular biomarkers for cancer.
Do a longitudinal analysis of discrete negative emotions and health-services use in elderly individuals?,The interactions indicate the importance of negative emotions and the larger social and developmental context in health care services use among elderly individuals.
Is large artery stiffness related to plasma cholesterol in older subjects with hypertension?,"In the largest cohort of elderly hypertensive subjects studied to date, plasma cholesterol per se was not associated with large artery stiffness. Such independence from cholesterol increases the potential for artery stiffness measurements to additionally contribute to cardiovascular risk assessment in this population."
Do methylation patterns define two types of hyperplastic polyp associated with colorectal cancer?,The findings support the existence of morphological and molecular heterogeneity among HP and highlight a subset that is likely to have significant malignant potential.
Does sodium oxybate demonstrate long-term efficacy for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy?,"This controlled trial provides evidence supporting the long-term efficacy of sodium oxybate for the treatment of cataplexy. In contrast with antidepressant drug therapy, there is no evidence of rebound cataplexy upon abrupt discontinuation of treatment."
"Are rating scales for inattention and sleepiness correlated in adults with symptoms of sleep disordered breathing syndrome , but not in adults with symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder?","Scores on rating scales for sleepiness (ESS) and inattention (AD score on the ADHDRS) are not significantly correlated in adults with early childhood onset inattention, but they are significantly correlated in sleepy snorers. Thus, in patients presenting primarily with early childhood onset inattention, sleepiness is not associated with and does not explain the inattention, even though increasing sleepiness and inattention may be associated symptoms in sleepy snorers."
Are low cholesterol levels associated with short-term mortality in older patients with ischemic stroke?,"Short-term mortality following ischemic stroke is higher in older participants with low TC levels, independent of a large number of factors. Low TC levels might be useful in identifying frail older participants at high risk of stroke short-term mortality."
Are cD55 expression patterns on intestinal neuronal tissue divergent from the brain?,"In contrast with the CNS, enteric neurones express CD55 and enteric glial cells lack CD55 expression. CD55, produced by neuronal cells, attached to elastic fibres surrounding the plexuses is proposed to protect the CD55 negative glial cells within plexuses."
Does bacillus subtilis GlcK activity require cysteines within a motif that discriminates microbial glucokinases into two lineages?,"Our results emphasize the necessity of cysteines within the CXCGX(2)GCXE motif for GlcK activity. On the other hand, the C321A mutation led to higher GlcKC321A enzymatic activity with respect to the wild type's, suggesting more adequate glucose phosphorylation."
Does a multidisciplinary approach to the focal form of congenital hyperinsulinism lead to successful treatment by partial pancreatectomy?,"A multidisciplinary approach to patients with the focal form of congenital hyperinsulinism can distinguish focal from diffuse disease, localize focal lesions, and permit partial pancreatectomy with cure in most patients."
Do type 1 diabetic children have abnormal lipid profiles during pubertal years?,Plasma CT levels of type I diabetic children are increased in comparison to non-diabetic children and do not follow the usual decreasing pattern during puberty.
Does frontal lobe gray matter density decrease in bipolar I disorder?,"The observation of a gray matter density decrease in the left anterior cingulate, which processes emotions, in bipolar subjects is consistent with prior reports that used region-of-interest analytic methods. Decreased gray matter density in the right inferior frontal gyrus, which processes nonverbal and intrinsic functions, supports nondominant hemisphere dysfunction as a component of bipolar disorder."
Is the amount of calcium-deficient hexagonal hydroxyapatite in aortic valves influenced by gender and associated with genetic polymorphisms in patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis?,Calcification of stenotic aortic valves consists of Ca-deficient hexagonal hydroxyapatite. Gender and genetic polymorphisms have an impact on the degree of aortic valve calcification.
Does an increased circulating blood volume prevent hypotension after pheochromocytoma resection?,"Expansion of the CBV by alpha-blocker therapy was related to lower blood pressures after resection of the pheochromocytoma. Expansion of the CBV by an alpha blocker may have increased the elastance of blood vessels. Preoperative blood volume expansion does not preclude hypotension after tumour resection. Although the CBV value itself is not a predictor for hypotension after tumour resection, pulse dye-densitometry provides values of CO and CBV simultaneously, assisting in the management of volume resuscitation and/or the need for catecholamines."
Do opiate addicts lack error-dependent activation of rostral anterior cingulate?,The attenuation of this error signal in anterior cingulate cortex may play a role in loss of control in addiction and other forms of impulsive behavior.
Do neurofibrillary tangles mediate the association of amyloid load with clinical Alzheimer disease and level of cognitive function?,These findings are consistent with a sequence of pathologic events whereby the effect of amyloid deposition on clinical disease is mediated by neurofibrillary tangles.
Does rTMS reduce focal brain hyperperfusion in two patients with EPC?,"Our findings suggest that a single rTMS session reduces focal epileptogenic activity and could be an alternative approach for epileptic-resistant patients, but efficacy should be confirmed in a larger series."
Does neurogenic pain relief by repetitive transcranial magnetic cortical stimulation depend on the origin and the site of pain?,"Motor cortex rTMS was found to result in a significant but transient relief of chronic pain, influenced by pain origin and pain site. These parameters should be taken into account in any further study of rTMS application in chronic pain control."
"Is genetic variation in the human vitamin D receptor associated with muscle strength , fat mass and body weight in Swedish women?","Genetic variation in the VDR is correlated with muscle strength, fat mass and body weight in premenopausal women. Further functional studies on the poly A microsatellite are needed to elucidate whether this is the functionally relevant locus or if the polymorphism is in linkage disequilibrium with a functional variant in a closely situated gene further downstream of the VDR 3'UTR."
Is alpha-fodrin cleaved by caspase-3 in a chronic ocular hypertensive ( COH ) rat model of glaucoma?,"This confirms our previous finding of caspase-3 cleavage of alpha-fodrin in COH retinas and parallels pathology seen in Alzheimer's disease, in which neurons undergo chronic caspase activation, slow build-up of cleavage products, and delayed apoptosis. If caspase activation in glaucoma leads to protracted rather than rapid retinal ganglion cell apoptosis, a much longer therapeutic window exists for apoptosis inhibition with caspase inhibitors such as BIRC4."
Is weight stabilisation associated with improved survival duration and quality of life in unresectable pancreatic cancer?,Weight stabilisation over an 8 week period in weight-losing patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer was associated with improved survival duration and QoL.
Is pretreatment antimicrobial susceptibility testing cost saving in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori?,"Pretreatment antimicrobial susceptibility testing is more effective and cost saving and, in health systems that confirm cost advantage, microbial susceptibility testing should be routinely used for eradication of H. pylori infection."
"Is occult hypoperfusion associated with increased mortality in hemodynamically stable , high-risk , surgical patients?",Elevated blood lactate levels are associated with a higher mortality rate and postoperative complications in hemodynamically stable surgical patients.
Is pioglitazone effective therapy for elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus?,"Pioglitazone monotherapy, or added to a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin demonstrated no significant differences in effectiveness while exhibiting similar adverse events in patients aged > or =65 years compared with patients aged <65 years. Well-controlled randomised clinical trials are recommended to confirm the impact of pioglitazone therapy on the glycaemic and lipid control in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes."
Does valerian appear to reduce symptoms for patients with chronic insomnia in general practice using a series of randomised n-of-1 trials?,Valerian was not shown to be appreciably better than placebo in promoting sleep or sleep-related factors for any individual patient or for all patients as a group.
Does partial acetylation of polyethylenimine enhance in vitro gene delivery?,"Reduction of the buffering capacity of PEI greatly enhanced the gene delivery activity of the polymer. The mechanism is not yet understood, but the enhancement may be caused by more effective polyplex unpackaging, altered endocytic trafficking, and/or increased lipophilicity of acetylated PEI-DNA complexes. Future studies will address these possibilities in more detail."
Are distinct portions of anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex activated by reward processing in separable phases of decision-making cognition?,"Neural activity within the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, pregenual ACC, and striatum mediate distinct representations of reward-related information that are deployed at different stages during a decision-making episode."
Is glial reduction in amygdala in major depressive disorder due to oligodendrocytes?,The glial cell reduction previously found in the amygdala in MDD is primarily due to oligodendrocytes.
Do subcortical and ventral prefrontal cortical neural responses to facial expressions distinguish patients with bipolar disorder and major depression?,"Compared with healthy controls and MDD patients, BD patients demonstrated increased subcortical and ventral prefrontal cortical responses to both positive and negative emotional expressions."
Is infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 associated with cognitive deficits in bipolar disorder?,Serologic evidence of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection is associated with cognitive impairment in individuals with bipolar disorder.
Are high nuclear grade and negative estrogen receptor significant risk factors for recurrence in DCIS?,Nuclear grade remains the most significant factor for breast recurrence after DCIS. Hormone receptor status identifies a subset of patients with more favourable prognosis.
Does human oocyte maturity in vivo determine the outcome of blastocyst development in vitro?,These phenomena suggest that oocyte maturity produced in vivo determine the fertilization potential and subsequent blastocyst quality in vitro.
Is longer breastfeeding an independent protective factor against development of type 1 diabetes mellitus in childhood?,Longer exclusive and total breastfeeding appears as an independent protective factor against type 1 diabetes.
Does clinical trial substantiate the predictive value of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation in glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide?,"This prospective clinical trial identifies MGMT-methylation status as an independent predictor for glioblastoma patients treated with a methylating agent. The association of the epigenetic inactivation of the DNA repair gene MGMT with better outcome in this homogenous cohort may have important implications for the design of future trials and supports efforts to deplete MGMT by O-6-benzylguanine, a noncytotoxic substrate of this enzyme."
Does [ Studies on chemical constituents from the stem of Schisandra sphaerandra ]?,Three pentacyclic triterpene carboxylic acid (5-7) were isolated from Schisandreae for the first time.
Does perioperative intravenous lidocaine have preventive effects on postoperative pain and morphine consumption after major abdominal surgery?,"The perioperative administration of systemic small-dose lidocaine reduces pain during surgery associated with the development of pronounced central hyperalgesia, presumably by affecting mechanoinsensitive nociceptors, because these have been linked to the induction of central sensitization and were shown to be particularly sensitive to small-dose lidocaine."
Does variation in breast cancer count using SEER and IARC multiple primary coding rules?,Breast cancer case counts are dependent on the multiple primary coding rules used.
Is docetaxel combined with trastuzumab an active regimen in HER-2 3+ overexpressing and fluorescent in situ hybridization-positive metastatic breast cancer : a multi-institutional phase II trial?,Trastuzumab plus docetaxel is an active and well-tolerated regimen in women with HER-2 3+ overexpressing or FISH-positive metastatic breast cancer.
Are specific epileptic syndromes rare even in tertiary epilepsy centers : a patient-oriented approach to epilepsy classification?,"Specific epilepsy syndromes included in the current ILAE classification are rare even in a tertiary epilepsy center. Most patients are included in unspecific categories that provide only incomplete information. In contrast, all of the patients could be classified by the five-dimensional patient-oriented classification, providing all essential information for the management of the patients with a high degree of interrater reliability."
Are areas of interictal spiking associated with metabolic dysfunction in MRI-negative temporal lobe epilepsy?,Metabolic dysfunction is present in focal areas of interictal spiking in nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy. These findings confirm that functional abnormalities can be detected in vivo in radiographically normal-appearing cortex exhibiting abnormal excitability.
Do patients with temporoparietal ictal symptoms and inferomesial EEG benefit from anterior temporal resection?,We conclude that anterior and inferomesial interictal epileptiform temporal discharges and at times even intracranial EEG monitoring may be misleading. Anteromesial temporal resection is ineffective in patients with posterior temporoparietal clinical ictal features.
Is the histologic grade a main prognostic factor for patients with intracranial ependymomas treated in the microneurosurgical era : an analysis of 258 patients?,"The application of a uniform diagnostic criteria for grading ependymomas highlighted the key role of tumor histology in clinical outcome in a cohort of patients who were treated in the microsurgical era. The recently proposed grading scheme is likely to be practically useful, reproducible, and clinically applicable."
Is platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor expression an independent prognostic factor in colorectal cancer patients after curative surgery?,The PD-ECGF expression originated from stromal macrophages was a predictor for favorable outcome after curative resections for colorectal cancer.
Does a simple vascular calcification score predict cardiovascular risk in haemodialysis patients?,The present vascular calcification scoring represents a simple tool for the assessment of cardiovascular risk related with vascular calcifications in chronic HD patients.
Does pulsed tissue Doppler imaging detect early myocardial dysfunction in asymptomatic patients with severe mitral regurgitation?,TDI systolic indices can predict postoperative left ventricular function in patients with asymptomatic MR undergoing surgical correction.
Is vascular endothelial growth factor increased in cerebrospinal fluid after traumatic brain injury in infants and children?,"VEGF is increased in CSF after pediatric TBI, and this increase is associated with an increase in CSF adenosine. These results may imply that a component of the vascular regenerative response of the brain is initiated rapidly after TBI and continues for several days after injury. Further investigation is warranted to determine 1). whether this association is causative, 2). the role of adenosine in triggering the increase in CSF VEGF concentration, and 3). the exact role VEGF that plays after injury."
Is primary dystonia more responsive than secondary dystonia to pallidal interventions : outcome after pallidotomy or pallidal deep brain stimulation?,This study indicates that primary dystonia responds much better than secondary dystonia to pallidal procedures. We could not distinguish a difference in efficacy between pallidotomy and pallidal deep brain stimulation. The presence of basal ganglia abnormalities on the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan is an indicator of a lesser response to pallidal interventions for dystonia.
Do [ Specific psychopathologic reactions in refugee populations and victims of torture ]?,Based on the results torture is the most intense form of trauma leading to intensive psychopathological responses including chronic PTSD. Results show that the psychopathological response is most intense and most frequent in the population of torture survivors compared to the refugee population.
Does postnatal repeated maternal deprivation produce age-dependent changes of brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in selected rat brain regions?,"Our data suggest that MD produces a significant reduction of BDNF expression within prefrontal cortex and striatum, which may render these structures less plastic and more vulnerable under challenging conditions."
Is mitochondrial complex I subunits expression altered in schizophrenia : a postmortem study?,"The schizophrenia-specific reduction in complex I subunits in the prefrontal cortex is consistent with one of schizophrenia's most prominent deficits, namely, hypofrontality, thus further supporting the hypothesis of mitochondrial dysfunction in this disorder. The abnormal, bidirectional expression of complex I in various brain regions, rather than in a circumscribed area, supports the idea of impaired cerebral circuitry in schizophrenia."
Is age at natural menopause linked with the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor region : a sib-pair study?,"Possibly, age at natural menopause in the more or less normal range is not part of the spectrum of phenotypes determined by mutations in the FSH-receptor gene. Alternatively, our results might be explained by genetic heterogeneity in the left tail of the distribution of menopausal age. This can limit the chance of finding a genetic locus, especially if this factor has a modest contribution to the phenotype."
Does loss of BRCA2 correlate with reduced long-term survival of sporadic breast cancer patients?,Allelic loss at the BRCA2 locus may be of use as a negative predictor for metastases-free and overall survival.
Is polo-like kinase 1 ( PLK1 ) expression associated with cell proliferative activity and cdc2 expression in malignant lymphoma of the thyroid?,These results suggest that PLK1 regulates the cell cycle progression of thyroid lymphoma cells in the G2-M-phase.
Is elevation in plasma MMP-9 following carotid endarterectomy associated with particulate cerebral embolisation?,Plasma MMP-9 only rises after CEA in patients with evidence of embolisation. This increase is more pronounced in those with high numbers of emboli. These data suggest that the increase in MMP-9 is due to cerebral damage caused by embolisation.
Does mental stress inhibit pain perception and heart rate variability but not a nociceptive withdrawal reflex?,"Distraction by PASAT altered autonomic activity and inhibited pain but failed to affect withdrawal reflex responses, while attention had no effect on either parameter. Psychological distraction and attention may have different effects on noxious evoked pain perception and autonomic activity. Pain relief during PASAT probably involves supraspinal mechanisms."
Does alexithymia predict the persistence of medically unexplained physical symptoms?,"Outcome of the UPS and general health perception at follow-up are not strongly associated and are predicted by different variables. Alexithymia, however, is not an important predictor for the outcome in the majority of UPS patients."
Is normal tension glaucoma associated with the common apolipoprotein E gene polymorphisms?,"ApoE gene polymorphisms are not linked to normal tension glaucoma, suggesting that this gene does not have a role in the pathogenesis of optic neuropathy in this disease."
Does an extended 10-core transrectal ultrasonography guided prostate biopsy protocol improve the detection of prostate cancer?,Adding 4 lateral peripheral biopsies to the conventional sextant biopsy (10-core biopsy strategy) technique has increased the cancer detection rate by 25.5% without significant morbidity and without increasing the number of insignificant cancers. 10-core biopsy protocol was superior to all probable 8-core biopsy protocols in our study group. Additional biopsies from suspicious areas detected by transrectal ultrasonography revealed no further benefit if 10-core technique was used. We therefore suggest that 10-core biopsy protocol should be the preferred strategy in early detection of prostate cancer.
Do children show decreased dynamic balance after mild traumatic brain injury?,"Children with a mild TBI still showed balance deficits at 12 weeks postinjury. These deficits should be taken into consideration when planning a return to physical activities, particularly to those that require subtle balance skills."
Does lipopolysaccharide administration enhance hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in newborn rats?,LPS potentiates hypoxic-ischemic insult in a dose-dependent fashion to cause brain damage in neonatal rats.
Do patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy differ from healthy subjects with respect to subcortical volumes?,"We concluded that extratemporal lobe epilepsy in general is not associated with diminished volumes in the studied subcortical structures, which contrasts with findings in temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Thus, both entities differ both cortically and subcortically. However, we found that small putamen volume was bilaterally associated with absent or rare generalised tonic-clonic seizures, implicating the putamen in the control of the most disabling seizure type, independent of the site of neocortical focus."

Does superoxide during reperfusion contribute to caspase-8 expression and apoptosis after transient focal stroke?,"The results suggest that increased reactive oxygen species production during reperfusion may contribute to the induction of caspase-8, thereby exacerbating apoptosis after FCI."
Does reversal of early diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities necessarily reflect tissue salvage in experimental cerebral ischemia?,"After brief ischemic periods, normalization of the DWI does not necessarily imply that the tissue is normal. Neurons already exhibit evidence of structural damage and stress. Normal GFAP staining suggests that other nonneuronal cell populations may partially compensate for altered fluid balances at the time of DWI reversal despite the presence of neuronal injury. These observations suggest that caution is warranted when relying solely on DWI for assessment of ischemic damage."
Do periodontal infections contribute to elevated systemic C-reactive protein level?,"The extent of increase in CRP levels in periodontitis patients depends on the severity of the disease after adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Also, there are elevated levels of CRP associated with infection with subgingival organisms often associated with periodontal disease, including P.g., P.i., C.r., and B.f. Recent investigations emphasized the role of moderate elevated CRP plasma levels as a risk factor for CVD. The positive correlation between CRP and periodontal disease might be a possible underlying pathway in the association between periodontal disease and the observed higher risk for CVD in these patients."

Conversely, BMD increased during the additional 12 months of therapy regardless of GH dose. Lower doses of GH, effective in improving body composition in adults with GHD, do not appear to be effective in children with PWS."
Is serum angiotensin I-converting enzyme reduced in Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis irrespective of genotype?,"Considering ACE gene polymorphism, serum ACE levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are lower than in controls. Serum ACE levels reflect a part of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease."
Do upon prolonged allergen exposure IL-4 and IL-4Ralpha knockout mice produce specific IgE leading to anaphylaxis?,"We conclude that upon long-term allergen exposure, alternative switch mechanisms independent of IL-4 and IL-4Ralpha may induce IgE but not asthma-like lung pathology. This may be relevant for the development of allergic disease, since long-term allergen exposure is a frequent condition during allergic sensitization."
Is endothelial dysfunction in resistance arteries related to high blood pressure and circulating low density lipoproteins in previously treated hypertension?,"High diastolic BP and high serum LDL were associated with impaired maximal AIR and reduced sensitivity to AIR, respectively, independently of smooth muscle cell responsiveness to nitroprusside. This indicated decreasing endothelial function in small resistance arteries with increasing BP and increasing LDL in hypertension. Endothelial function was not significantly related to vascular structure of the resistance arteries or to diabetes in these patients with long-standing hypertension."
Does th2 cytokine profile in infants predispose to improved graft acceptance after liver transplantation?,"We conclude from the data that the physiological balance toward a Th2 cytokine profile of infants in the first months of life predisposes to improved graft acceptance. Transplantation of children with biliary atresia as early as possible, avoiding Th1 stimulation by recurrent infections and vaccinations, may have a positive impact on overall tolerance."
Does social influence on the sexual behaviors of adolescent girls in at-risk circumstances?,The social context of adolescent girls' lives can promote sexual activity and unprotected sex.

Is influenza A infection an important cause of febrile seizures?,"The influenza A Sydney variant (H3N2) was not associated with an increased risk of febrile seizures when compared with the previous influenza A Wuhan variant (H3N2) or H1N1 viruses. However, in hospitalized children, influenza A is associated with a higher incidence of febrile seizures and of repeated seizures in the same febrile episode than are adenovirus or parainfluenza infections. The pathogenesis of these observations warrants additional studies. Complex febrile seizures, particularly multiple febrile seizures at the time of presentation, have been thought to carry an adverse long-term prognosis because of its association with a higher incidence of epilepsy. Repeated febrile seizures alone, particularly if associated with influenza A infection, may not be as worrisome as children with complex febrile seizures because of other causes, which requires additional investigation. This may subsequently have an impact on reducing the burden of evaluation in a subset of children with complex febrile seizures."
Does exclusive breastfeeding reduce acute respiratory infection and diarrhea deaths among infants in Dhaka slums?,"The important role of appropriate breastfeeding practices in the survival of infants is clear from this analysis. The reduction of ARI deaths underscores the broad-based beneficial effect of exclusive breastfeeding in prevention of infectious diseases beyond its role in reducing exposure to contaminated food, which may have contributed to the strong protection against diarrhea deaths."
"Is mRP8 , a new member of ABC transporter superfamily , identified by EST database mining and gene prediction program , highly expressed in breast cancer?","The selective expression of MRP8 (ABCC11), a new member of ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily could be a molecular target for the treatment of breast cancer."

Is the image of the hard palate/nasal fossa floor in panoramic radiography : the controversy over?,"The junction of the nasal septum with the NFF and the posterior portions of the HP/NFF form the upper image of the HP/NFF. Most of the image is real, although a small part is a ghost image of the horizontal plates of the palatine bones and of the posterior region of the palatine processes of the maxillae."
Do impact of conventional tomography on prediction of the appropriate implant size?,"This study demonstrated that the use of tomograms increases the efficacy of periapical + panoramic images, with respect to the prediction of appropriate implant size, by a factor of 2.5. Therefore, conventional cross-sectional tomography is recommended for treatment planning before installation of single tooth implants."
Are igE levels the same in chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) and control subjects when stratified by allergy skin test results and rhinitis types?,"Elevated IgE and positive AST indicate allergen sensitization, but are not necessarily indicators of symptomatic allergic diseases. There was no association between IgE levels and CFS, indicating that atopy was probably not more prevalent in CFS. Therefore, TH2-lymphocyte and IgE-mast cell mechanisms are unlikely causes of CFS."
Is elevated expression of hTERT associated with dysplastic cell transformation during human oral carcinogenesis in situ?,These results indicate that enhanced expression of telomerase activity occurs early during human oral carcinogenesis and support the critical role of telomerase in the development of human oral cancer.
Does coarctectomy reduce neoaortic arch obstruction in hypoplastic left heart syndrome?,Patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome undergoing aortic arch enlargement with autologous tissue are less likely to require intervention for neoaortic arch obstruction compared with those having homograft patch reconstruction. Excision of all ductal tissue by means of coarctectomy reduces the risk of recurrent aortic arch obstruction. An aggressive approach to reconstruction of the arch and the use of autologous tissue at the time of stage I palliation is advocated.

Are concomitant lower serum albumin and vitamin D levels associated with decreased objective physical performance among Japanese community-dwelling elderly?,Concomitant lower serum albumin and lower vitamin D levels are associated with decreased muscle strength and balance capability in both men and women. These results suggest that serum albumin and 25OHD together may be an important target for strategies aiming to achieve a healthy life and prevent loss of independence in community-dwelling elderly.
Do electromyographic patterns suggest changes in motor unit physiology associated with early osteoarthritis of the knee?,"VM activation changes at the level of the MU with symptomatic knee OA, and this change is influenced by radiographic severity. Poor muscle quality may explain the pattern observed with higher KL grades, but alternative factors (e.g., nerve or joint injury, physical inactivity or muscle composition changes) should be examined in early OA."
Does lack of agreement in pediatric emergency department discharge diagnose from clinical and administrative data sources?,"ED diagnoses retrieved from electronic administrative sources and manual chart review frequently disagree, even if similar diagnosis codes are grouped. Agreement varies by institution and by diagnosis. Further work is needed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis coding; development of a grouping system specific to pediatric emergency care may be beneficial."
Does large-scale analysis of transcriptional cis-regulatory modules reveal both common features and distinct subclasses?,"Our findings demonstrate that cis-regulatory modules share common features that help to define them as a class and that may lead to new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation. However, these properties alone may not be sufficient to reliably distinguish regulatory from non-regulatory sequences. We also demonstrate that there are distinct subclasses of cis-regulatory modules that are more amenable to in silico detection than others and that these differences must be taken into account when attempting genome-wide regulatory element discovery."
Does gene expression variation in Down 's syndrome mice allow prioritization of candidate genes?,This is the first analysis addressing inter-individual gene expression levels as a function of trisomy. We propose a strategy allowing discrimination between candidates for the constant features of DS and those genes that may contribute to the partially penetrant signs of DS.
Are functional cortical changes of the sensorimotor network associated with clinical recovery in multiple sclerosis?,Pseudotumoral MS lesions affecting the motor system can determine short-term cortical changes characterized by the recruitment of pathways in the unaffected hemisphere. The regain of function of motor areas of the affected hemisphere seems to be a critical factor for a favorable recovery.
Do racial/ethnic differences in physician distrust in the United States?,"Racial/ethnic differences in physician distrust are less uniform than previously hypothesized, with substantial geographic and individual variation present."
Is gH responsiveness in a large multinational cohort of SGA children with short stature ( NESTEGG ) related to the exon 3 GHR polymorphism?,"Our data, based on a large cohort, showed that the exon 3 GHR polymorphism is associated with responsiveness to rhGH treatment in SGA children with short stature."
Does no association exist between E-cadherin gene polymorphism and tumor recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after transplantation?,The results of this study show no association exists between the E-cadherin genotype and the risk of tumor recurrence in Chinese patients with HCC.
Is periodontitis characterized by elevated PAI-1 activity?,"In periodontitis, elevated levels of PAI-1 activity are observed compared with healthy controls. This may increase the potential for impaired fibrinolysis, a condition that results in a prothrombotic state. We suggest that this state, if left untreated, may contribute to an increased risk for CVD."
Are severe coronary artery calcifications associated with ischemia in patients undergoing medical therapy?,The presence of a CAC score greater than 400 is associated with ischemia in a population receiving good medical therapy. The detection of significant CAC in these individuals warrants additional evaluation for ischemia.
Are low E2F1 transcript levels a strong determinant of favorable breast cancer outcome?,"Assessment of E2F1 at the mRNA level in primary breast cancer is a strong determinant of breast cancer patient outcome. E2F1 expression identified patients at low risk of metastasis irrespective of the estrogen receptor and ERBB2 status, and demonstrated similar prognostic performance to different gene expression-based predictors."
Does cross-study analysis of gene expression data for intermediate neuroblastoma identify two biological subtypes?,"Our findings support the hypothesis that neuroblastoma consists of two biologically distinct subgroups that differ by characteristic gene expression patterns, which are associated with divergent clinical outcome."
Does mammographic density correlate with Ki-67 expression or cytomorphology in benign breast cells obtained by random periareolar fine needle aspiration from women at high risk for breast cancer?,"Given the lack of correlation of mammographic breast density with either cytomorphology or Ki-67 expression in RPFNA specimens, mammographic density and Ki-67 expression should be considered as potentially complementary response biomarkers in breast cancer chemoprevention trials."
Is renal pathological change in patients with type 2 diabetes always diabetic nephropathy : a report of 52 cases?,NDRD was a common feature in Type 2-diabetic patients with renal involvement. The absence of retinopathy and short periods of diabetic history may be useful indicators for diagnosis of NDRD clinically.
Is type IV collagen 7s domain an independent clinical marker of the severity of fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis before the cirrhotic stage?,This is the first report to demonstrate a consistent and profound elevation of the type IV collagen 7s domain in NASH patients with advanced fibrosis (before progression to the stage of cirrhosis) compared with those with mild fibrosis.
Does hepatitis B viral load predict survival of HCC patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy?,"For HCC patients with HBV chronic infection/exposure, a high viral load prior to treatment is an adverse factor for survival and may be associated with a higher incidence of severe hepatitis during chemotherapy. Future strategies to improve the prognosis of HCC patients undergoing chemotherapy should consider supportive therapy that incorporates antiviral therapies to reduce HBV viral load."
Are lactating women restricting milk low on select nutrients?,"Milk restriction compromised protein and nutrient intakes in lactating women who restricted milk to <250 mL. Vitamin/mineral supplements helped exclusively breastfeeding milk restrictors improve their vitamin D and calcium intakes. Milk restriction is not recommended during lactation and where unavoidable, nutrients provided by milk should be compensated for by other foods or supplements."
Does the quality of chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation override importance of timing of defibrillation?,"In this animal model of cardiac arrest, it was the quality of the chest compressions, rather then the priority of either initial defibrillation or initial chest compressions, that was the predominant determinant of successful resuscitation."
Does aDMA correlate with portal pressure in patients with compensated cirrhosis?,These results suggest that ADMA may play a pathophysiological role in portal hypertension by contributing to the relative intrahepatic NO deficiency typical of endothelial dysfunction.
Are changes of biochemical markers of bone turnover and YKL-40 following hormonal treatment for metastatic prostate cancer related to survival?,"Serial monitoring of serum PINP, BAP, CTX-I, and YKL-40 in metastatic PC patients during hormonal treatment provided information of prognosis."
Does lower extremity muscle activation and alignment during the soccer instep and side-foot kick?,"Certain lower extremity muscle groups face different demands during the soccer instep kick compared to the soccer side-foot kick. Similarly, the support limb muscles face different demands than the kicking limb during both kicks. Better definition of lower extremity function during kicking provides a basis for improved insight into soccer player performance, injury prevention, and rehabilitation."
Are late-life depressive symptoms associated with both hyperactivity and hypoactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis?,"Late-life depressive symptoms are associated with both hyperactivity and hypoactivity of the HPA axis, which suggests distinct mechanisms for these associations."
Are a decrease in N-acetylaspartate and an increase in myoinositol in the anterior cingulate gyrus associated with behavioral and psychological symptoms in Alzheimer 's disease?,We conclude that BPSD and the decline in cognitive function in AD might have separate pathologies.
Does elastic plasma protein film blended with platelet releasate accelerate healing of diabetic mouse skin wounds?,"Our results suggest that CPPP is a promising biologically active dressing for full-thickness skin wounds. CPPP can be an entirely autologous biological dressing, suggesting that it is free from the risk of transmission of pathogens through blood products."
Is universal antenatal human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) testing programme cost-effective despite a low HIV prevalence in Hong Kong?,"The universal antenatal testing programme in Hong Kong is largely efficient. In view of the low prevalence of HIV infection, high rates of HIV testing and uptake of antiretroviral prophylaxis are crucial to the success of the programme."
Does femoral shaft bowing influence the correction angle for high tibial osteotomy?,The correction angle by FTA for HTO should be calculated taking femoral and/or tibial shaft bowing in the frontal plane into account.
Is expression of RNA virus proteins by RNA polymerase II dependent expression plasmids hindered at multiple steps?,"Insufficient cytoplasmic mRNA levels and premature polyadenylation prevent expression of RSV-F by RNA polymerase II dependent expression plasmids. Since RSV replicates in the cytoplasm, the presence of premature polyadenylation sites and elements leading to nuclear instability should not interfere with RSV-F expression during virus replication. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the destabilisation of the RSV-F and VSV-G mRNAs and the different requirements for their rescue by insertion of an intron remain to be defined."
Is bone marrow trephine combined with immunohistochemistry superior to bone marrow aspirate in follow-up of myeloma patients?,It is strongly recommended that BMTB is performed and adequately investigated with immunohistochemistry during follow-up of MM.
Do slow eye movements and subjective estimates of sleepiness predict EEG power changes during sleep deprivation?,"Results suggest that subjective and EEG changes associated with higher sleepiness are paralleled by an increase in slow eye movement activity, but this relationship exists almost exclusively with the eyes closed. Hence, its use in practical and operational contexts seems limited."
Does vitamin D status and health correlate among German adults?,Vitamin D deficiency is a public health issue in Germany. We identified a number of determinants with potential for primary prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Risk and benefits of preventive actions need to be examined in further studies.
"Is methylation of CASP8 , DCR2 , and HIN-1 in neuroblastoma associated with poor outcome?",Our study indicates that clinically aggressive neuroblastoma tumors have aberrant methylation of multiple genes and provides a rationale for exploring treatment strategies that include demethylating agents.
Is persistent type 2 endoleak after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm associated with adverse late outcomes?,"Persistent type 2 endoleak is associated with an increased incidence of adverse outcomes, including aneurysm sac growth, the need for conversion to open repair, reintervention rate, and rupture. These data suggest that patients with persistent type 2 endoleak (>6 months) should be considered for more frequent follow-up or a more aggressive approach to reintervention."
Is expression level of beta-catenin associated with prognosis of esophageal carcinoma?,Beta-catenin expression in ESCC is of great importance.
"Is human blastocyst morphological quality significantly improved in embryos classified as fast on day 3 ( > or=10 cells ) , bringing into question current embryological dogma?","Fast cleaving embryos not only reach the blastocyst stage at a similar rate to intermediate cleaving embryos, but also exceed morphological quality criteria on day 5. Fast cleaving embryo transfers demonstrated a high clinical potential."
Is human ClC-6 a late endosomal glycoprotein that associates with detergent-resistant lipid domains?,"We conclude that human ClC-6 is an endosomal glycoprotein that partitions in detergent resistant lipid domains. The differential sorting of endogenous (late endosomal) versus overexpressed (early and recycling endosomal) ClC-6 is reminiscent of that of other late endosomal/lysosomal membrane proteins (e.g. LIMP II), and is consistent with a rate-limiting sorting step for ClC-6 between early endosomes and its final destination in late endosomes."
Is cardiac autonomic modulation evaluated by heart interval variability unaltered but subtly widespread in the indeterminate Chagas ' disease?,"As a group, indeterminate Chagas' disease subjects showed unaltered short-term heart interval variability. Individual somewhat widespread of majority of time- and frequency-domain indices, from depressed to exacerbated ones appears to exist. This conforms to a variable cardiac autonomic modulation in this form of disease, suggesting that the majority of chagasics has no lesions, and a minority has subtle lesions of the efferent innervation-sinus node complex."
Is guideline-adherent antithrombotic treatment associated with improved outcomes compared with undertreatment in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation . The Euro Heart Survey on Atrial Fibrillation?,"Antithrombotic undertreatment of high-risk patients with AF was associated with a worse cardiovascular prognosis during 1 year, whereas overtreatment was not associated with a higher chance for major bleeding."
Do rheumatoid arthritis patients have elevated antibodies to cross-reactive and non cross-reactive antigens from Proteus microbes?,"The elevated levels of antibodies against Proteus antigenic epitopes (which are cross-reactive or non cross-reactive with human tissue antigens) observed indicates that this enhanced bacterial immune response in RA patients is specifically triggered by Proteus microbes. Furthermore, the correlation of anti-peptide antibody indices with the biochemical markers of disease activity indicates that these antibodies exert damaging cytotoxic effects on joint tissues during the course of the disease."
Does pretreatment 18F-FAZA PET predict success of hypoxia-directed radiochemotherapy using tirapazamine?,"This study provides compelling evidence that hypoxia imaging using (18)F-FAZA PET is able to predict the success of RCT of tumor-bearing mice using the hypoxia-activated chemotherapeutic agent tirapazamine. Pretreatment (18)F-FAZA PET, therefore, offers a way for the individualization of tumor treatment involving radiation. The data suggest that by reserving hypoxia-directed therapy to tumors with high (18)F-FAZA uptake, improvement of the therapeutic ratio is possible, as the therapeutic effect of tirapazamine seems to be restricted to hypoxic tumors."
Are increased levels of circulating IL-16 and apoptosis markers related to the activity of Whipple 's disease?,Circulating levels of both IL-16 and nucleosomes were increased in WD. This finding provides simple and non-invasive tools for the diagnosis and the prognosis of WD.
Are helicobacter pylori-induced changes in the gastric mucosa associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) activation?,HP infection increases the proliferative rate of gastric foveolar cells in conjunction with an increased apoptotic rate and activation of MAPK(ERK). MAPK activation seems to be a significant and persistent event in the HP-induced neoplastic transformation.
Is ultrasonography a sensitive tool for monitoring localized scleroderma?,USG was found to be a sensitive tool for assessing the activity and extent of LS lesions in paediatric patients. Further studies are needed to assess its general applicability for monitoring these patients.
Does patient education and regular surveillance result in earlier diagnosis of second primary melanoma?,"Upon analysis of our data, subsequent primary cutaneous melanomas were found to be significantly thinner than initial primary melanomas at the time of diagnosis. This suggests that earlier diagnosis may be the result of patient education and careful follow up. Counselling on the risk of developing a second primary melanoma, education regarding clinical characteristics of melanoma, and routine lifelong follow up should be provided to all patients diagnosed with a cutaneous melanoma."
Does lithium therapy improve neurological function and hippocampal dendritic arborization in a spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 mouse model?,"The effect of lithium on a marker altered early in the course of SCA1 pathogenesis, coupled with its positive effect on multiple behavioral measures and hippocampal neuropathology in an authentic disease model, make it an excellent candidate treatment for human SCA1 patients."
Is renal injury during shock wave lithotripsy significantly reduced by slowing the rate of shock wave delivery?,"Slowing the rate of delivery to 30 SW/min has a dramatic protective effect on the integrity of the kidney vasculature. This finding in our established pig model suggests a potential strategy to improve the safety of lithotripsy. As it was shown that a reduced SW rate also improves the efficiency of stone fragmentation, a slow rate appears to be a means to improve both the safety and efficacy of SWL."
Does concurrent alcohol and tobacco use during early adolescence characterize a group at risk?,Concurrent alcohol and tobacco use during early adolescence is associated with characteristics that are well known as risk factors for later alcohol use problems and dependence and that should be targeted by prevention programs.
Does rosiglitazone ameliorate diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting reactive oxygen species and its downstream-signaling pathways?,"Rosiglitazone treatment prevented glomerular injury in diabetic rats, which was closely related with its roles of reducing reactive oxygen species, NF-kappaB activation and MCP-1 expression in the early phase of diabetic nephropathy."
Is video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery more favorable than thoracotomy for resection of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer?,"Patients undergoing VATS lobectomy for clinical stage I NSCLC, despite having more comorbidities, had fewer postoperative complications. The approaches are equivalent in operative time, blood loss, length of stay, and survival rate. Compared with thoracotomy, VATS lobectomy for patients with clinical stage I NSCLC appears to be a less morbid operation."
Are betamethasone-related acute alterations of microtubule-associated proteins in the fetal sheep brain reversible and independent of age during the last one-third of gestation?,Alteration of neuronal cytoskeletal proteins caused by antenatal betamethasone exposure is transient and independent of age during late gestation.
Are coronary endothelial dysfunction and hyperlipidemia independently associated with diastolic dysfunction in humans?,Coronary endothelial dysfunction and hyperlipidemia are independently associated with impaired relaxation in patients with normal ejection fraction in the absence of occlusive CAD and heart failure. The current study suggests a new potential mechanism for the development of endothelial and diastolic dysfunction in humans.
Do changes in mood predict disease activity and quality of life in patients with psoriasis following emotional disclosure?,"Changes in mood following ED predicted improvements in disease severity in patients with psoriasis. However, the degree of improvement did not differ between intervention and control patients."
Is combination chemotherapy including combretastatin A4 phosphate and paclitaxel effective against anaplastic thyroid cancer in a nude mouse xenograft model?,Both triple-drug combinations demonstrated excellent antineoplastic activity against ATC. The correlative findings in xenografts were consistent with vascular disruption but not direct inhibition of cell proliferation as the primary antineoplastic mechanism contributed by CA4P. These regimens warrant further investigation in clinical trials for ATC.
Are arterial-wave reflections increased in heart failure patients with a left-ventricular assist device?,"Central arterial pressure-wave reflection is increased in end-stage HF patients on LVAD support compared with those on inotropic drugs, leading to an increase in aortic augmented pressure, AI(a), and systolic tension time index. The AI(a) is also higher in LVAD patients than in healthy controls. This increased central arterial-wave reflection places an additional hemodynamic load on the LVAD device and may have relevance to the medical management of patients after LVAD placement and to the longevity of the LVAD device itself."
Do patients use an internet technology to report when things go wrong?,PATIENTS will use internet technology to report their perceptions of health-related adverse events. Some of the patient-reported events reported will be serious.
Does genistein cause regression of endometriotic implants in the rat model?,Genistein caused a statistically significant regression of endometriotic implants.
Does alcohol abuse among U.S. Navy recruit who were maltreated in childhood?,Substantial numbers of personnel with alcohol-related problems may be using alcohol to self-medicate due to a history of childhood abuse. Attention to the association between alcohol abuse and childhood maltreatment might help improve the efficacy of military alcohol reduction programs.
Is muscle fatigue resistance during stimulated contractions reduced in young male smokers?,"In young men smoking does not significantly affect quadriceps muscle mass and contractile properties, but does reduce fatigue resistance of the quadriceps muscle, which was not attributable to differences in physical activity."
"Are cell-free mRNA concentrations of CRH , PLAC1 , and selectin-P increased in the plasma of pregnant women with preeclampsia?","CRH, PLAC1, and selectin-P are distributed differently in preeclampsia cases compared to controls and correlate with signs of preeclampsia."
Is tSH concentration within the normal range associated with cognitive function and ADHD symptoms in healthy preschoolers?,"Despite being within the normal range, high TSH concentrations are associated with a lower cognitive function and high TSH and low free T4 with ADHD symptoms in healthy preschoolers. Statistically significant differences were observed in the highest quartiles of TSH, suggesting a need for re-evaluation of the upper limit of the normal TSH range."
Does [ Minimal pair reproduction correlate with spelling ability ]?,These empirically ascertained data add credence to the phonological deficit theory. It appears that phonological deficits can be revealed by relatively simple tasks that concern the representation of speech sounds rather than the ability to use these sounds. This suggests that the interface between auditory/sensory and cognitive/operational processing is deficient in the children affected.
Is predominant treatment failure in postprostatectomy patients local : analysis of patterns of treatment failure in SWOG 8794?,The pattern of treatment failure in high-risk patients is predominantly local with a surprisingly low incidence of metastatic failure. Adjuvant radiation to the prostate bed reduces the risk of metastatic disease and biochemical failure at all postsurgical PSA levels. Further improvement in reducing local treatment failure is likely to have the greatest impact on outcome in high-risk patients after prostatectomy.
Are alexithymia and occupational burnout strongly associated in working population?,"Even though both alexithymia and depression are associated with burnout, alexithymia may be an independent risk factor for occupational burnout."
Do emotional reactions following exposure to idealized bodies predict unhealthy body change attitudes and behaviors in women and men?,These results are indicative of gender differences in: (a) reactions to idealized bodies; (b) psychological traits that predispose individuals to experience these reactions; and (c) types of body change behavior that are associated with these reactions.
Is antinuclear antibody associated with a more advanced fibrosis and lower RNA levels of hepatitis C virus in patients with chronic hepatitis C?,ANA is associated with a more advanced liver fibrosis and lower serum HCV RNA level in patients with CHC.
"Are uterine leiomyosarcomas characterized by high p16 , p53 and MIB1 expression in comparison with usual leiomyomas , leiomyoma variants and smooth muscle tumours of uncertain malignant potential?","p16 is overexpressed in uterine leiomyosarcomas compared with leiomyomas, benign leiomyoma variants and STUMPs, suggesting that p16 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant uterine smooth muscle neoplasms. p16, in combination with p53 and MIB1, may be of value as an adjunct to morphological examination in the assessment of problematic uterine smooth muscle tumours, although further large-scale studies with follow-up are necessary to confirm this."
Does recommendations for promoting the engagement of older people in activities to prevent fall?,"These recommendations represent a consensus based on current knowledge and evidence, but the evidence base from which these recommendations were developed was limited, and not always specific to prevention of falls. To increase the effectiveness of falls-prevention interventions, further research is needed to identify the features of falls-prevention programmes that will encourage older people's engagement in them."
Are bronchoalveolar lavage cellular profiles in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease predictive of disease progression?,"BAL findings provide only limited prognostic information in SSc-ILD. Neutrophilia on BAL is linked to early mortality, but BAL findings are not linked to long-term survival or the rapidity of progression of lung disease. The usefulness of BAL to define alveolitis in SSc is questionable."
Does a receptor-like kinase mediate the response of Arabidopsis cells to the inhibition of cellulose synthesis?,The results show that THE1 mediates the response of growing plant cells to the perturbation of cellulose synthesis and may act as a cell-wall-integrity sensor.
Does the topography of aortic atherosclerosis enhance its precision as a predictor of stroke?,Atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta stands out as a predictor of late stroke. High risk is predominantly linked to atheromas in its distal part and lesser curvature.
Is the dysbindin gene ( DTNBP1 ) associated with methamphetamine psychosis?,"Our genetic evidence suggests that DTNBP1 is involved in psychotic liability not only for schizophrenia but also for other psychotic disorders, including substance-induced psychosis."
Does transcript-level annotation of Affymetrix probesets improve the interpretation of gene expression data?,"By refining the standard Affymetrix annotation of microarray probesets from the gene level to the transcript level and protein level, one can achieve a more reliable interpretation of their experimental data, which may lead to discovery of more profound regulatory mechanism."
Does prevalence and correlate of partner violence among South African adolescents?,There are high levels of partner violence among high school students in Cape Town. Interventions to address this problem should focus on violence-related attitudes and outcome expectancy.
Does epidermal growth factor receptor variant III status define clinically distinct subtypes of glioblastoma?,"Established prognostic factors in GBM were not predictive of outcome in the EGFRvIII-positive subset, although this requires confirmation in independent data sets. GBMs negative for both EGFRvIII and YKL-40 show less aggressive behavior."
Is in vivo reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages lacking ABCA1 expression impaired?,ABCA1 expression in macrophages contributes significantly to in vivo macrophage RCT. The important residual RCT observed from abca1-/- macrophages highlight the functionality of transporters that efflux to HDL.
Do new predictive equations improve monitoring of kidney function in patients with diabetes?,"The new predictive equations better estimate GFR than the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Although the MDRD equation remains the most accurate, it poorly predicts GFR decline, as it overestimates low and underestimates high GFRs. This bias is lesser with the MCQ and Cys-eGFR equations, so they better predict GFR changes."
Does polymorphism modulate symptomatic response to antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients with lone atrial fibrillation?,These results provide further evidence for a role of RAAS activation in the pathophysiology of AF and point to a potential role for stratification of therapeutic approaches by ACE genotype.
"Is whole-grain consumption associated with a reduced risk of noncardiovascular , noncancer death attributed to inflammatory diseases in the Iowa Women 's Health Study?","The reduction in inflammatory mortality associated with habitual whole-grain intake was larger than that previously reported for coronary heart disease and diabetes. Because a variety of phytochemicals are found in whole grains that may directly or indirectly inhibit oxidative stress, and because oxidative stress is an inevitable consequence of inflammation, we suggest that oxidative stress reduction by constituents of whole grain is a likely mechanism for the protective effect."
Do [ Analysis of the peer reviewed papers published in Shanghai Journal of Stomatology between 2001 and 2005 ]?,Shanghai Journal of Stomatology is one of the most important information sources on stomatology.
Is myocardial capillary supply limited in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy : a morphological analysis?,"Our morphologic findings show that the capillary supply, and thus the coronary reserve, is impaired in HCM with moderate hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. These data may partly explain the limitation of myocardial perfusion in HCM, which is associated with worse prognosis. Furthermore, we present evidence of actual loss of myocardial capillaries in HCM and a defective capillary growth."
Is the effect of large portion sizes on energy intake sustained for 11 days?,These results strengthen the evidence suggesting that increased portions contribute to the overconsumption of energy and to excess body weight.
Does parent overweight predict daughters ' increase in BMI and disinhibited overeating from 5 to 13 years?,Girls growing up in families differing in parental overweight had divergent developmental trajectories for BMI and disinhibited overeating. Findings reveal the need to focus prevention efforts on overweight parents of young children.
Are cardiorespiratory fitness and sedentary activities associated with adiposity in adolescents?,"Both moderate to high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness and sedentary activities, but not physical activity, are associated with lower abdominal adiposity, as measured by waist circumference."
Does birth weight correlate differently with cardiovascular risk factors in youth?,"Low birth weight was associated with childhood diabetes. High birth weight was correlated with childhood obesity and diabetes. Our data indicate different relationships between birth weight and the development of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes in childhood."
Is birth weight inversely associated with central adipose tissue in healthy children and adolescents?,"These results provide evidence that, even in childhood and adolescence, a higher birth weight is associated with higher FM and %BF, while a low birth weight is associated with TrFM, adjusted for FM."
Is dry eye-induced conjunctival epithelial squamous metaplasia modulated by interferon-gamma?,"Conjunctival epithelial response to experimental dryness is related to the degree of CD4+ T-cell infiltration and the level of IFN-gamma production. These findings suggest that IFN-gamma plays a pivotal role in promoting conjunctival squamous metaplasia in dry eye, and they provide insight into the immune pathogenesis of keratoconjunctivitis sicca."
Does acute enoxaparin treatment widen the therapeutic window for tPA in a mouse model of embolic stroke?,These data indicate that the LMWH enoxaparin can significantly increase the therapeutic time window in a mouse model of embolic stroke.
Is self-reported dietary supplement use confirmed by biological markers in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study ( MoBa )?,"The biochemical indicators examined in this study confirmed differences in self-reported micronutrient intake between supplement and non-supplement users for vitamin D, beta-carotene, folate, n-3 fatty acids, flavonoids and iodine."
Does gene expression correlate of postinfective fatigue syndrome after infectious mononucleosis?,Gene expression correlates of the cardinal symptoms of PIFS after IM have been identified. Further studies of these gene products may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of PIFS.
Does primary Gleason pattern impact survival after permanent interstitial brachytherapy for Gleason score 7 prostate cancer?,"The primary Gleason pattern did not impact CSS, bPFS, or OS in Gleason score 7 prostate cancer. Deaths from cardiovascular/pulmonary disease and second malignancies were 9.6 times more common than death from prostate cancer."
Is tACI expression associated with a mature bone marrow plasma cell signature and C-MAF overexpression in human myeloma cell lines?,"We conclude that TACI activation can upregulate c-maf expression which, in turn, controls cyclin D2, and integrin beta7 gene expression."
Is increase in physical activity energy expenditure associated with reduced metabolic risk independent of change in fatness and fitness?,"Increasing levels of physical activity may protect against metabolic disease even in the absence of improved aerobic fitness and reduced body fatness. Therefore, the combination of increasing levels of physical activity and avoidance of gain in fat mass is likely to be the most successful approach for preventing cardiovascular and metabolic disease."
Is cognitive performance in type 1 diabetes patients associated with cerebral white matter volume?,"Patients with diabetes demonstrated several subtle neuropsychological deficits, which were found to be related to white matter volume. Since patients with diabetic retinopathy had a smaller white matter volume, this suggests that cognitive decline is at least partly mediated by microvascular disease. This needs to be addressed in future studies."
Is the predictive ability of serum alpha-fetoprotein for hepatocellular carcinoma linked with the characteristics of the target population at surveillance?,"Serum AFP had a fairly stable predictive accuracy for HCC, with an optimal cutoff around 30 ng/ml. ALT level, viral status, and tumor size may significantly confound its ability to detect HCC."
Do blood-pressure categories in adolescence predict development of hypertension in accordance with the European guidelines?,The risk of developing hypertension in young adulthood may be predicted by BP categories and BMI at adolescence.
Is nuclear survivin associated with disease recurrence and poor survival in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma?,Nuclear presence of survivin may be an independent biomarker for disease recurrence and overall survival in patients with Stage I and II melanoma.
Is home blood pressure as reliable as ambulatory blood pressure in predicting target-organ damage in hypertension?,"These data suggest that home BP is as reliable as ambulatory monitoring in predicting hypertension-induced target-organ damage, and is superior to carefully taken office measurements."
Are genetic variants in the NOD2/CARD15 gene associated with early mortality in sepsis patients?,Our findings indicate a major role of NOD2/CARD15 coding variants for SRM. This may be indicative for a role of impaired barrier function and bacterial translocation in the pathophysiology of early sepsis related death.
Do milk thickeners influence anthropometric indices in childhood?,No association was found between the use of milk thickeners and weight-for-length/height z-scores in the first and fourth years of life. Future studies in other contexts would be helpful to further test this hypothesis.
Do sensory-motor and cognitive tests predict driving ability of persons with brain disorders?,"Compared with other studies, SMCTests have shown the highest predictive accuracy against true on-road driving ability as estimated in an independent data set and in persons with brain disorders. SMCTests also have the advantage of being able to comprehensively and objectively assess both sensory-motor and higher cognitive functions related to driving."
"Is eBV-infection in cardiac and non-cardiac gastric adenocarcinomas associated with promoter methylation of p16 , p14 and APC , but not hMLH1?",Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is significantly more frequent in EBV-associated GC compared to EBV-negative GC. Our data add new insights to the role of EBV in gastric carcinogenesis and underline that EBV-associated GC comprise a distinct molecular-pathologic as well as a distinct clinicopathological entity of GC.
Do diacylglycerol kinase β knockout mice exhibit lithium-sensitive behavioral abnormalities?,"These findings suggest that DGKβ KO mice exhibit lithium-sensitive behavioral abnormalities that are, at least in part, due to the impairment of Akt-GSK3β signaling and cortical spine formation."
Do comparative analysis of anchorage systems for micro implant orthodontics?,"The most widely used material was TiAl6V4; most of the surfaces were smooth; the most commonly used head type was the bracket; the most often produced length was the ""short"" one (8.0-9.9 mm), the most demanded diameter the ""smaller"" one (1.2-1.4 mms); six systems out of eleven had micro implants with ""extra"" and ""standard"" necks; only 3 systems out of eleven produced ""non self drilling""devices; all the micro implants analysed were able to withstand orthodontic forces between 150 g and 350 g; all devices were suitable for ""immediate loading""; all micro implants had to be removed; all micro implants could be used in growing patients."
"Does isometric strength assessment , part I : static testing accurately predict dynamic lifting capacity?","The Static Leg Lift, Static Arm Lift and Static Back (Torso) Lift are not appropriate for making predictions relative to dynamic lifting capacity. Given the likely degree of error in such predictions, and in light of potential safety concerns as reported by previous investigators, employers, clinicians and risk managers now have substantial objective evidence to call such testing into question."
Are episodic and chronic migraineurs hypersensitive to thermal stimuli between migraine attacks?,"Interictal sensitisation may predispose the migraineur to development of headaches, may be a marker of migraine activity, and a target for treatment."
Do iDH1 or IDH2 mutations predict longer survival and response to temozolomide in low-grade gliomas?,"IDH mutation appears to be a significant marker of positive prognosis and chemosensitivity in low-grade gliomas, independently of 1p-19q codeletion, whereas its impact on the course of untreated tumors seems to be limited."
Does data-driven identification of co-morbidities associated with rheumatoid arthritis in a large US health plan claim database?,"Data on a large number (> 60,000) of patients with a diagnosis of RA were used to analyze and to list a large number (> 2,000) of co-morbidities. Rank-ordering of RRs of diagnostic codes is a tool to identify quickly many conditions associated with RA."
Is insulin sensitivity reflected by characteristic metabolic fingerprints -- a Fourier transform mass spectrometric non-targeted metabolomics approach?,"Our results suggest that altered metabolite patterns that reflect changes in insulin sensitivity respectively the ISI(Matsuda) are dominated by lipid-related pathways. Furthermore, a metabolic transition state reflected by heterogeneous metabolite fingerprints may precede severe alterations of metabolism. Our findings offer future prospects for novel insights in the pathogenesis of the pre-diabetic phase."
Do prevalence of psychoactive substances use in a Lithuanian women 's prison revisited after 5 years?,Psychoactive substances are often used due to their psychological effect. inmates constitute a high-risk group of drug users and distributors of narcotic drugs. Intravenous narcotics stimulating dangerous behavior prevail in Lithuanian prisons. Women in prison are especially prone to smoking.
Is minimal hepatic encephalopathy associated with falls?,"Falls are more frequent in cirrhotic patients with MHE, particularly in those on treatment with psychoactive drugs, and are a significant cause for healthcare and hospitalization requirements."
Does formal medicine reconciliation within the emergency department reduce the medication error rates for emergency admissions?,"Streamlining the admission process for unscheduled patients leads to improvement in care, decreases prescribing errors and reduces either potential or actual harm. Moving pharmacists' work to the ED better aligns their input to the patient journey and utilises their knowledge and skills to the patient's benefit."
Is different persistence on initial basal supported oral therapy in Type 2 diabetics associated with unequal distributions of insulin treatment regimens under real-life conditions in Germany?,"The simulation indicates that the persistence on the initial basal supported oral therapy is associated with the resulting BOT : ICT ratio. Therefore, the unequal distribution between BOT and ICT of Type 2 diabetics treated with either insulin glargine or NPH insulin might be caused by different persistence on the initial BOT regimen."
Are stroke history and Chagas disease independent predictors of silent cerebral microembolism in patients with congestive heart failure?,"Chagas disease and stroke history are risk factors for MES independent of cardiac disease severity. Other mechanisms besides structural cardiac disease may be operative, increasing embolic risk in Chagas disease."

The meninges are not required for basement membrane establishment but are needed for remodeling as the brain expands. Specific changes in basement membrane composition may contribute to subsequent breakdown. Our study raises the possibility that primary meningeal defects may cortical dysplasia in some cases.
Does multivariate modeling identify neutrophil- and Th17-related factors as differential serum biomarkers of chronic murine colitis?,"Immunological profiling revealed strikingly similar colon profiles, yet distinctly different serum profiles for acute and chronic colitis. Neutrophil- and Th17-related factors were identified as predictive serum biomarkers of chronic colitis, but not acute colitis, despite their presence in colitic tissue of both diseases thereby demonstrating the utility of mathematical modeling for identifying disease-associated serum biomarkers."
Is confocal laser endomicroscopy a new imaging modality for recognition of intramucosal bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease in vivo?,CLE is a new tool that can image intramucosal bacteria in vivo in patients with IBD. Intramucosal bacteria are found more frequently and with a wider distribution in patients with IBD than in patients with a normal intestine.

Does inflammation in an individual joint predict damage to that joint in psoriatic arthritis?,Both joint tenderness and swelling are important predictors of joint damage in PsA.
Do adiposity and age explain most of the association between physical activity and fitness in physically active men?,Adiposity and age are the strongest predictors of VO(2)max in healthy men. The energy expended in moderate and vigorous physical activities is inversely associated with adiposity. Muscular fitness does not appear to be associated with physical activity as assessed by the IPAQ.
Does kIR receptor-ligand incompatibility predict killing of osteosarcoma cell lines by allogeneic NK cells?,"Variable MHC I and KIR ligand expression was observed in osteosarcoma cell lines and this resulted in variable susceptibility to NK cell-mediated killing predicted by the degree of KIR receptor-ligand incompatibility. Collectively, these data provide rationale for the study of KIR incompatible stem-cell transplant for osteosarcoma, although further studies with fresh osteosarcoma samples are necessary."
Does iron status in toddlerhood predict sensitivity to psychostimulants in children?,"If replicated, these findings suggest that more attention should be paid to optimizing body iron in early childhood."
Does adiponectin protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy by anti-apoptotic effects through AMPK up-regulation?,These data suggest that APN improved cardiac function through anti-apoptotic effects by up-regulation of AMPK in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy in mice.
Are iQGAP1 and IQGAP2 reciprocally altered in hepatocellular carcinoma?,"We conclude that increased IQGAP1 and/or decreased IQGAP2 contribute to the pathogenesis of human HCC. Furthermore, downregulation of IQGAP2 in HCC occurs independently of hypermethylation of the Iqgap2 promoter. Immunostaining of IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 may aid in the diagnosis of HCC, and their pharmacologic modulation may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver cancer."
Does daily genetic profiling indicate JAK/STAT signaling promotes early hepatic stellate cell transdifferentiation?,These data demonstrate unique clustered genetic profiles during the daily progression of HSC transdifferentiation and that JAK/STAT signaling may be critical in the early stages of transdifferentiation.
Is central macular thickness correlated with gestational age at birth in prematurely born children?,"Prematurely born children had thicker central maculae than those born at term. Regardless of ROP, the degree of prematurity was the most important risk factor for abnormal foveal development."
Does aversive reinforcement improve visual discrimination learning in free-flying honeybees?,"The present study supports the hypothesis that aversion conditioning is important for understanding how and what animals perceive and learn. By using this form of conditioning coupled with appetitive conditioning in the framework of a differential conditioning procedure, it is possible to uncover discrimination capabilities that may remain otherwise unsuspected. We show, therefore, that visual discrimination is not an absolute phenomenon but can be modulated by experience."
Are c-reactive protein and hormones but not IL-6 associated to body mass index in first trimester of pregnancy?,"The present investigation provides evidences on the positive relationship between BMI, leptin, insulin, HOMA-IR and CRP in early pregnancy. CRP but not IL-6 demonstrated a strong relation with overweight in pregnant women, as early as the tenth week."
Is peripheral chemosensor function blunted in moderate to severe chronic kidney disease?,Using a relatively non-invasive bedside test we provide evidence for a blunted peripheral chemosensor function in chronic kidney disease. We thereby lay the basis for interventional studies assessing chemosensor function in chronic kidney disease.
Does helicobacter pylori eradication improve pre-existing reflux esophagitis in patients with duodenal ulcer disease?,"In patients with reflux esophagitis associated with duodenal ulcer, a significant improvement in pre-existing reflux esophagitis was noted after H. pylori eradication."
"Is increased expression of Ki-67 in mantle cell lymphoma associated with de-regulation of several cell cycle regulatory components , as identified by global gene expression analysis?","A genetic signature distinguishing Ki-67high MCL from Ki-67low was established. The generated signature was used to assign new MCL samples to the high proliferative group, validating the association between these genes and proliferation in MCL."

Is high intensity aerobic interval exercise superior to moderate intensity exercise for increasing aerobic capacity in patients with coronary artery disease?,"High intensity aerobic interval exercise is superior to moderate exercise for increasing VO2peak in stable CAD-patients. As VO2peak seems to reflect a continuum between health and cardiovascular disease and death, the present data may be useful in designing effective training programmes for improved health in the future."
Do afferent limb ulcers predict Crohn 's disease in patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis?,ALUs seen on endoscopy are suggestive of CD in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who are not taking NSAIDs.
Do development of a renal tumor mimic model for learning minimally invasive nephron sparing surgical techniques?,"The described renal tumor mimic model reproducibly creates ex vivo and in vivo porcine kidney lesions. Lesion size and impedance do not change with the application of radio frequency energy. This model should be a valuable adjunct in the development, assessment and teaching of novel, nephron sparing, minimally invasive surgical techniques."

Does growth hormone improve body composition and motor development in infants with Prader-Willi syndrome after six months?,Infants with PWS show significant body composition and motor development improvement following 6 months GH therapy. We are investigating whether this improvement leads to long-term reductions in obesity.
Is urine vascular endothelial growth factor-A a useful marker for endometriosis?,"It is unlikely that urine VEGF-A(121, 165), as measured in this study, will be a useful non-invasive marker for endometriosis."
Is clopidogrel resistance associated with increased risk of recurrent atherothrombotic events in patients with acute myocardial infarction?,Up to 25% of STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI with stenting are resistant to clopidogrel and therefore may be at increased risk for recurrent cardiovascular events.
Does combined corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy alter survival in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,Our data suggest that combined corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy has no impact on survival in patients with IPF. This finding supports the evolving concept that chronic inflammation plays a minimal role in the progression of IPF and reinforces the importance of careful consideration of the risks and benefits of such therapies prior to their institution.
Does pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma demonstrate high proliferative activity?,Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma appears to be more clinically aggressive than classic large cell carcinoma with these findings indicating that large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma has a higher level of proliferative activity than classic large cell carcinoma.
Does [ 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in hepatocellular carcinoma on positron emission tomography correlate with alpha-fetoprotein ]?,"Serum AFP correlates significantly with both SUV and SUN ratio, indicating that AFP is involved in glucose metabolism and cell proliferation in HCC."
Does inhibition of IkappaB phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes attenuate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury?,Inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB by IkappaBalpha phosphorylation blockade could provide an effective approach to attenuation of ischemia/reperfusion injury. The cardioprotective effects of IMD-0354 include not only reduction of harmful neutrophil accumulation in myocardium but also inhibition of harmful cytokine and chemokine production by cardiomyocytes.
Does amphetamine activate connexin43 gene expression in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes through JNK and AP-1 pathway?,"These findings indicate that amphetamine activates Cx43 gene expression in cultured rat neonatal cardiac myocytes. Amphetamine mediates the Cx43 gene expression, at least in part, through the JNK pathway. These findings from our study suggest that Cx43 plays a role for the molecular mechanism of amphetamine-induced cardiac dysrhythmias."
Does cerebral venous flow velocity predict poor outcome in subarachnoid hemorrhage?,"Increased ICP values correlate with increased venous flow velocities. In SAH, increased ICP and increased venous flow velocities are associated with poor outcome. Flow velocity of the transversal sinus is a highly sensitive, reliable, and early predictor of outcome in SAH."
Is reduced expression of metastasis suppressor RhoGDI2 associated with decreased survival for patients with bladder cancer?,These results suggest that RhoGDI2 is an independent predictor of prognosis for patients with bladder cancer and provide clinical evidence in support of its involvement in cancer metastasis.
Does heme-oxygenase-1 expression correlate with severity of acute cellular rejection in lung transplantation?,"Similar to what occurs in human lung transplantation, HO-1 expression is increased in a rodent lung transplant model of ACR and correlates with the severity of rejection. Altering its expression does not appear to affect the degree of ACR."
Do preprocedural inflammatory markers predict restenosis after successful coronary stenting?,"Preprocedural inflammatory markers in stable angina subjects undergoing coronary artery stent deployment did not correlate with the development of in-stent restenosis. Differences in pathobiology between stable and unstable coronary syndromes, the widespread use of statins with anti-inflammatory activity in our cohort of patients, along with different mechanisms underlying the early angiographic appearances of restenosis as compared to clinical end points, most likely explain our findings."
Does the lateral recumbent head-down position decrease the incidence of epidural venous puncture during catheter insertion in obese parturients?,"Adoption of the lateral recumbent head-down position for the performance of lumbar epidural blockade, in labour at term, reduces the incidence of lumbar epidural venous puncture in these obese parturients."
"Is in humans , the seasonal variation in poly-unsaturated fatty acids related to the seasonal variation in violent suicide and serotonergic markers of violent suicide?","Our results show that there is a true seasonality in long-chain PUFAs, such as AA, EPA and DHA. The results suggest that the seasonality in PUFAs may be related to the incidence of violent suicide and the expression of the serotonin transporter complex."
"Are serum levels of a Th1 chemoattractant IP-10 and Th2 chemoattractants , TARC and MDC , elevated in patients with systemic sclerosis?","These results suggest that both Th2 chemoattractants, TARC and MDC, and a Th1 chemoattractant IP-10 play a role in the development of SSc."
Do effect of gender and defensive opponent on the biomechanics of sidestep cutting?,"A simulated defense player causes increased lower limb movements and forces, and should be a useful addition to laboratory protocols for sidestepping. Gender differences in the joint kinematics suggest that increased knee valgus may contribute to ACL injury risk in women, and that the hip and ankle may play an important role in controlling knee valgus during sidestepping. Consideration of the entire lower extremity contributes to an understanding of injury mechanisms and may lead to better training programs for injury prevention."
Does knee biomechanics of the support leg in soccer kick from three angles of approach?,"Soccer kicks using a high angle of approach increase the medial and posterior GRF, which is indicative of an altered stance during the kick, resulting in an altered balance. Such kicks are accompanied by significant alterations in knee joint kinematics and an increased BF activation around ground contact. Soccer kicks from an angled approach may induce significant loads to knee joint structures of the support leg."
Is retailer participation in cigarette company incentive programs related to increased levels of cigarette advertising and cheaper cigarette prices in stores?,"Stores that participate in cigarette company incentive programs feature more prominent placement of cigarettes and advertising, and may have cheaper cigarette prices."
Does autobiographical memory predict cognitive but not somatic change in sleep apnea patients vulnerable for affective disorder?,Generalizability to other patient populations awaits further research. Reliability of the vulnerability assessment prior to the OSAS onset was not established.
Are class I and II HLA genes associated with susceptibility and age at onset in Finnish families with type 1 diabetes?,"Estimates of genetic relative risk obtained from the case-pseudo control design are negatively biased and the prospective LTS model is an appropriate choice, when there are non-susceptible subjects in the population with variable age at onset. Based on the analysis of T1DM, we conclude that there are gene(s) in the HLA region that are associated with susceptibility and/or age at onset of T1DM, and this should be taken into account in future studies."
Is hyperghrelinemia a common feature of Prader-Willi syndrome and pituitary stalk interruption : a pathophysiological hypothesis?,"We conclude that hyperghrelinemia in PWS and PSI is not related to GH secretion. We hypothesize that a major site of ghrelin action is at the hypothalamic level and that a 'ghrelin resistance' syndrome may be present in these patients, primarily due to a hypothalamic defect. Combined alterations such as impaired serotonin receptor regulation associated with abnormal ghrelin responsiveness are probably responsible for obesity in PWS."
Does zinc supplementation for four months affect plasma copper concentration in infants?,"Zinc supplementation of 10 mg/d for 4 mo in this study did not affect copper status, as assessed by plasma copper concentration and hematological parameters, diagnostics of copper deficiency."
Do radiation-blocking glasses allow vision during ophthalmic plaque radiation therapy?,Leaded radiation safety glasses improved patients' quality of life without sacrificing radiation safety.
Does immunoglobulin improve a model of acute motor axonal neuropathy by preventing axonal degeneration?,"The therapeutic efficacy of IVIg in an AMAN model was confirmed. IVIg may not affect the production or catabolism of anti-GM1 IgG, but it may prevent axonal degeneration of motor nerves."
Are effects of protein deprivation on growth and small intestine morphology improved by glutamine or glutamate in gastrostomy-fed rat pups?,These results suggest that neither Gln nor Glu supplementation can substitute effectively for whole protein in the developing rat small intestine for the outcomes that were evaluated.
Is low-dose-rate brachytherapy superior to high-dose-rate brachytherapy for bladder cancer?,"Local control of HDR brachytherapy for bladder cancer was disappointing and late toxicity unexpectedly high. The increase in late toxicity suggested a short repair half-time of 0.5-1 h for late-responding normal bladder tissue, which would not support HDR brachytherapy in the treatment of bladder cancer. The analysis demonstrated that the calculation of equivalent HDR schedules on the basis of the LDR schedules used in clinical practice might be hazardous."
Does clopidogrel inhibit platelet-leukocyte interactions and thrombin receptor agonist peptide-induced platelet activation in patients with an acute coronary syndrome?,"Clopidogrel attenuates the agonist effects of ADP and TRAP on platelet secretion, aggregation, and formation of platelet-monocyte and platelet-neutrophil conjugates in patients with ACS. These effects may all contribute to the clinical benefits of the drug in these syndromes."
Does apolipoprotein E control the risk and age at onset of Parkinson disease?,"The APOE-4 allele increases risk and decreases age at onset of PD, an association that may not be dependent upon cognitive impairment."
"Is cumulative embryo score , not endometrial thickness , best for pregnancy prediction in IVF?","CES alone, and not combined with endometrial thickness, is a statistically significant factor in pregnancy rates that may be clinically useful in decisions regarding number of embryos transferred to ensure a better pregnancy rate."
Does videodermatoscopy enhance diagnostic capability in some forms of hair loss?,"The results indicate that videodermatoscopy represents a very useful tool in the evaluation of hair loss, both for differential diagnosis (especially in early, transitional and mild forms) and for prognostic evaluation. It allows rapid, detailed, and non-invasive observation of the scalp skin and hair, and it provides high-resolution quality imaging."
Is the generic 15D instrument valid and feasible for measuring health related quality of life in Parkinson 's disease?,"15D is a valid, feasible, and sensitive tool to assess quality of life in PD. PD has a major impact on HRQoL, which is related to disease progression. Mobility, eating, speech, and sexual functions are most affected. The ADL measure of the UPDRS and the 15D provide an easily assessable view of HRQoL in PD."
Is alexithymia no risk factor for exacerbation in spasmodic torticollis patients?,"High alexithymia did not lead to increased abnormal head movements to stressors, but may result in a subtle increase in tonic level of sympathetic activity."
Does n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide on admission have prognostic value across the whole spectrum of acute coronary syndromes?,"The measurement of NT-proBNP on admission improves the early risk stratification of patients with ACS, suggesting the need for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies."
Does reinvestigation of trihydroxycholestanoic acidemia reveal a peroxisome biogenesis disorder?,"The absence of clear peroxisomal abnormalities in the patient's fibroblasts, including a normal peroxisomal localization of catalase, implies that even when all peroxisomal functions in fibroblasts are normal, a peroxisome biogenesis disorder cannot be fully excluded, and further studies may be needed. In addition, the authors' findings imply that there is no longer evidence for the existence of trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA oxidase deficiency as a distinct disease entity."
Does complete elimination of reflux symptoms guarantee normalization of intraesophageal and intragastric pH in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD )?,Fifty percent of patients with GERD without BE continue to exhibit pathologic GERD and low intragastric pH despite PPI therapy that achieves complete reflux symptom control.
Does laparoscopy assist surgical decision making in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis?,"Laparoscopy performed in the ICU can provide information regarding intestinal viability which can guide further surgical management. It is feasible and tolerated well even in critically ill neonates less than 1,000 g."
Is hyperglycemia associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates in neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis?,Hyperglycemia is common in infants with NEC admitted to the ICU and is associated with an increase in late mortality and longer intensive care stay. Aggressive glycemic control may improve outcome in this group of infants.
Is polo-like kinase 1 overexpressed in prostate cancer and linked to higher tumor grades?,"These results demonstrate a high rate of PLK1-positivity in prostate cancer which suggests involvement of PLK1 in tumorigenesis and progression in this tumor entity. Therefore, targeted strategies focussing on PLK1 inhibition might represent a promising new chemotherapeutic approach in prostate cancer."
Is single nucleotide polymorphism in the low-density lipoprotein receptor associated with a threefold risk of stroke . A case-control and prospective study?,"This is the first prospective study to suggest an association between a polymorphism in the LDL receptor and stroke. Because this association is independent of lipid levels, our results point toward a hitherto unknown function of this receptor in the brain."
Do undetectable preoperative levels of serum CA 19-9 correlate with improved survival for patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma?,"These findings suggest that patients who present with undetectable preoperative CA19-9 levels and potentially resectable pancreatic cancer, regardless of advanced stage, should be considered candidates for aggressive therapy."
Do evolving treatment in a decade of pediatric burn care?,"Over a 10-year period, the program achieved a significant reduction in resource utilization while increasing the number of patients treated and maintaining a low incidence of infection. This was due in large part to a shift to ABC and the use of PS."
Does prenatal alcohol exposure cause long-term serotonin neuron deficit in mice?,"Upon prenatal alcohol exposure, an increased concentration of active caspase-3 and a decreased number of 5-HT-immunostaining neurons in the brainstem were observed at E18. The decreased number of 5-HT neurons persisted to the young adult stage of postnatal day 45. This suggests that ethanol has a long-lasting effect on 5-HT deficit. A fetal alcohol exposure-rendered lasting deficit of 5-HT and other transmitter systems may underlie the neuropsychiatric deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder."
Does risk-sensitive foraging theory elucidate risky choices made by heroin addicts?,These data suggest that risky choices of heroin-dependent individuals can be understood and predicted with the application of RSF theory. This research suggests that an evolutionarily old behavioral process may contribute to the risky behavior of the drug-dependent.
Are up for grabs -- authors a dime a dozen : the problem of multiple authors?,"The solution to this problem may be found in one of two ways: strict enforcement of standards of authorship by journal editors, i.e., rejection of articles, no matter how good they may appear to be, because they violate these standards, and/or adoption of authorship standards as understood by commercial publishers."
Does surfactant administration acutely affect cerebral and systemic hemodynamics and gas exchange in very-low-birth-weight infants?,The increases in mCBFv after surfactant administration were predominantly due to increases in Paco(2) and not changes in MABP.
Does supplementation of milk formula with galacto-oligosaccharides improve intestinal micro-flora and fermentation in term infants?,Supplementing infant formula with GOS at a concentration of 0.24 g/dl stimulates the growth of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli in the intestine and stool characteristics are similar to in term infants fed with human milk.
Is endoscopic measurement of Barrett 's esophagus length unreliable - a prospective comparative biopsy study?,"In the majority of patients, there is only a moderate correlation between the endoscopic and the histological extent of BE. However, we also found a substantial individual variability in endoscopic-histological correlation; therefore studies on the effects of treatment on BE must consider both the endoscopic and histopathological BE lengths."
Is rise in serum PSA of 1.5 ng/mL above 24-month nadir after external beam radiotherapy predictive of biochemical failure?,A PSA increase of 1.5 ng/mL or more above the 24-month nadir can be used to predict for ASTRO-defined failure after EBRT and may be used to identify patients at risk early-on.
Is plasmin protective in experimental renal interstitial fibrosis?,"Plasminogen, the key proenzyme in the plasminogen-plasmin system, does not protect mice from experimental interstitial fibrosis and may have significant pathogenetic effects. These findings, together with other recently published studies in the biology of renal fibrosis, imply that effects of proteins such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) on renal fibrosis occur independently from the generation of plasmin."
Is tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid a marker of brain injury after aortic surgery?,"These preliminary results suggest that cerebrospinal fluid tau levels reflect brain injury. Because tau levels may separate the patients with temporary neurologic dysfunction, they may serve as a useful marker of brain injury."
Does matrix metalloproteinase-9 genotype influence large artery stiffness through effects on aortic gene and protein expression?,"Because the T allele was associated with greater MMP-9 mRNA and protein levels, the greater large artery stiffness in T-allele carriers may be secondary to excessive degradation of the arterial elastic matrix. The consequent higher pulse pressure may increase susceptibility to myocardial ischemia."
Do neurologic signs predict periventricular white matter lesions on MRI?,Simple neurologic tests can predict the presence or absence of PVWD on MRI.
Does microtubule self-organisation by reaction-diffusion processes cause collective transport and organisation of cellular particles?,This process constitutes a novel physical chemical mechanism by which chemical energy is converted into collective transport of colloidal particles along a given direction. Self-organisation of this type provides a new mechanism by which intra cellular particles such as chromosomes and vesicles can be displaced and simultaneously organised by microtubules. It is plausible that processes of this type occur in vivo.
Is cSF levels of neurofilament a valuable predictor of long-term outcome after cardiac arrest?,Levels of CSF NFL give a reliable measure of the brain damage following cardiac arrest and the levels are highly predictive of poor outcome. This observation urges the development of sensitive serum assays of this marker to be used in the clinical setting.
Does surfactant improve survival rate in preterm infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia?,"Surfactant, as currently used, is associated with a lower survival rate in preterm infants with CDH. The use of surfactant replacement in premature infants with CDH can be recommended only within the context of a randomized clinical trial."
Does plasma neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity influence left ventricular mass in pheochromocytoma?,Our results indicate that mitogenic effect of neuropeptide Y may play a role in pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with pheochromocytoma.
Do c. elegans PAR proteins function by mobilizing and stabilizing asymmetrically localized protein complexes?,"These results identify two cellular mechanisms by which the PAR proteins polarize the C. elegans zygote, and they suggest mechanisms by which PAR proteins may polarize cells in diverse animal systems."
Does dNA-methylation analysis identify the E-cadherin gene as a potential marker of disease progression in patients with monoclonal gammopathies?,Methylation of certain genes can be detected frequently in patients with monoclonal gammopathies. The current data suggest that methylation of ECAD is a marker of disease progression in patients with MM and PCL.
Does imidapril improve L-NAME-exacerbated nephrosclerosis with TGF-beta 1 inhibition in spontaneously hypertensive rats?,"These data suggest that imidapril prevents glomerular and arteriolar damages and renal functions, through inhibiting both TGF-beta 1 production and apoptosis induction."
Are lower erythropoietin and iron supplementation required in hemodialysis patients with hepatitis C virus infection?,"Anti-HCV(+) HD patients had higher serum EPO levels and required less EPO and iron replacement as compared to anti-HCV(-) patients. Because of the changes in iron metabolism, iron treatment should be carefully administered in HD patients with HCV."
Is tissue Doppler imaging superior to strain rate imaging and postsystolic shortening on the prediction of reverse remodeling in both ischemic and nonischemic heart failure after cardiac resynchronization therapy?,"Ts-SD is the most powerful predictor of LV reverse remodeling and was consistently useful for ischemic and nonischemic heart failure. However, PSS is useful only for nonischemic pathogenesis, whereas the role of SRI parameters was not supported by the present study."
Is pulse pressure more susceptible to the white coat effect than is systolic blood pressure : observations from real-life ambulatory blood pressure monitoring?,"Although pulse pressure is related to the mechanical properties of large arteries, it is also influenced by the white coat effect, a neurogenic process. Furthermore, in hypertensive but not in normotensive subjects, the white coat effect on pulse pressure is significantly more pronounced than on SBP."
Is screening flexible sigmoidoscopy using an upper endoscope better tolerated by women?,"Screening FS in women using an upper endoscope is a feasible approach to colorectal cancer screening. Patients screened with an upper endoscope reported less pain and discomfort compared to standard sigmoidoscope while overall satisfaction did not differ. The trend toward increased polyp detection in patients undergoing FS with an upper endoscope may be related to a more thorough examination due to less patient discomfort and/or an increased depth of insertion of the upper endoscope. Thinner, more flexible endoscopes should be considered when performing screening FS in women."
Is perihematomal edema in primary intracerebral hemorrhage plasma derived?,"Acute perihematomal oligemia occurs in acute ICH but is not associated with MRI markers of ischemia and is unrelated to edema formation. Increased rates of water diffusion in the perihematomal region independently predict edema volume, suggesting the latter is plasma derived."
Does a new scoring system for the chances of identifying a BRCA1/2 mutation outperform existing models including BRCAPRO?,The scoring system is useful in identifying mutations particularly in BRCA2. The algorithm may need modifying to include pathological data when calculating whether to screen for BRCA1 mutations. It is considerably less time-consuming for clinicians than using computer models and if implemented routinely in clinical practice will aid in selecting families most suitable for DNA sampling for diagnostic testing.
Do real-time monitoring of keratin 5 expression during burn re-epithelialization?,"EGFP expression correlated with K5 expression during wound healing and therefore serves as a good marker of re-epithelialization. This transgenic model allows noninvasive, real-time assessment of in vivo K5 expression and will be useful in the study of wound healing."
Is computerized physician order entry of diagnostic tests in an intensive care unit associated with improved timeliness of service?,"Introduction of computerized physician order entry for ordering ""stat"" tests in an intensive care unit is associated with improved timeliness of these tests."
Do transcutaneous bilirubin measurements and serum total bilirubin levels in indigenous African infants?,"From these results, we can conclude that TcB measurements are a useful and reliable index for estimating STB levels in pigmented neonates, including those with hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus. In the absence of reliable STB measurements, the relatively simple and noninvasive TcB measurements can be an important adjunct in directing phototherapy and exchange transfusions, thereby preventing bilirubin-induced morbidity and mortality in low-technology clinical environments."
Is anterior cingulate activation in high trait anxious subjects related to altered error processing during decision making?,"These results support the idea that HTA subjects devote more processing resources to decision making than do NTA subjects during times in which there is little chance of incorrect responding (i.e., the low-error-rate condition). The extent to which this altered activation within the anterior cingulate contributes to anxiety-proneness remains to be determined."
Do the methods for handling missing data in clinical trials influence sample size requirements?,These results can help investigators plan clinical trials to select the primary outcome and a priori specify the way missing data will be handled.
Does selective brain cooling during and after prolonged global ischemia reduce cortical damage in rats?,This study shows that selective brain cooling increases survival from prolonged global ischemia and reduces neuronal injury in the cerebral cortex as well as the striatum and hippocampus.
Is platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta induced during tumor development and upregulated during tumor progression in endothelial cells in human gliomas?,Our results indicate that the malignant phenotype in human glial tumors is associated with an upregulation of the PDGFR-beta on endothelial cells of vessels which vascularize the tumor. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate vessel growth and differentiation in normal and pathologic states.
Are serum anti-SS-B/La and IgA rheumatoid factor markers of salivary gland disease activity in primary Sjögren 's syndrome?,"Measuring serum levels of anti-SS-B/La and IgA-RF would be useful when monitoring salivary responses in therapeutic trials, especially in patients with minimal salivary function."
Is left ventricular shape the primary determinant of functional mitral regurgitation in heart failure?,These data indicate that transformation of left ventricular shape (increased chamber sphericity) is the most likely substrate for the development of functional mitral regurgitation.
Are human ovarian surface epithelial cells capable of physically restructuring extracellular matrix?,Human ovarian surface epithelial organoids may be useful for the study of normal and abnormal ovarian events such as ovulatory wound repair and cyst formation.
Are new strategies needed in diffuse malignant mesothelioma?,"The survival was independent of age, sex, and smoking behavior. It was longer in patients with earlier-stage disease, a good performance status, a longer duration of symptoms, an absence of pain, and who were treated with combined surgery and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy using anthracyclines yielded more remissions (9 of 21) than that using nonanthracyclines (0 of 13). The remission rate after primary chemotherapy with anthracyclines (7 of 16) may be higher than in recurrent tumor (2 of 14). In future trials, stratification into primary chemotherapy and chemotherapy of recurrent cancer is suggested. There is a need for multitechnique trials incorporating primary chemotherapy."
Are serial ECGs less accurate than serial CK-MB results for emergency department diagnosis of myocardial infarction?,Serial changes in ECGs during a three- to four-hour interval were associated with the diagnosis of myocardial infarction but were infrequent and less accurate than serial CK-MB levels obtained for the same interval.
Is neurocognitive impairment an independent risk factor for death in HIV infection . San Diego HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center Group?,The HIV-infected individuals with NP impairment had a higher risk of dying than those without impairment. This was particularly true for those meeting syndromic diagnostic criteria.
Is ambulatory blood pressure superior to clinic blood pressure in predicting treatment-induced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy . SAMPLE Study Group . Study on Ambulatory Monitoring of Blood Pressure and Lisinopril Evaluation?,"In hypertensive subjects with LVH, regression of LVH was predicted much more closely by treatment-induced changes in ABP than in the clinic BP. This provides the first longitudinally controlled evidence that ABP may be clinically superior to traditional BP measurements."
Does histological correlate to pig gastrointestinal wall layers imaged in vitro with the magnetic resonance endoscope?,In vitro imaging with the magnetic resonance endoscope shows three to five wall layers of the porcine gastrointestinal tract depending on the segment scanned. This degree of gut wall resolution suggests that endoscopic magnetic resonance imaging may have potential for local staging of gastrointestinal tumors.

Does expression of CTLA4-Ig by biolistically transfected mouse islets promote islet allograft survival?,"Transfection of allogeneic mouse islets with human CTLA4-Ig results in prolonged allograft survival. Although on histology mononuclear cells are present in the area of the transfected graft, they do not appear to infiltrate or destroy the islet graft."
"Are alpha-2,3-Sialyltransferase type 3N and alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase type VII related to sialyl Lewis ( x ) synthesis and patient survival from lung carcinoma?","In lung carcinoma, ST3N and Fuc-TVII may both be related to sLe(x) synthesis, and Fuc-TVII is a more important indicator of poor prognosis."
Are evidence that `` myofibroblast-like '' cells the cellular source of capsular collagen in hepatocellular carcinoma?,"Our findings demonstrate that activated hepatic stellate cells (i) are responsible for increased peritumour collagen production in non-encapsulated HCC and colorectal metastasis, and (ii) may be implicated in tumour capsule formation in HCC and metastasis stroma development. Thus, stellate cells may influence the local hepatic invasion by these tumours."
Are stromal fibroblasts associated with collagen IV in scar tissues of alkali-burned and lacerated corneas?,The enhanced expression of collagen IV by the fibroblastic cells in the stroma of injured corneas is consistent with the notion that they may contribute to the formation of basal lamina-like structures in injured corneas.
Does prevalence and correlate of cannabis use and dependence in young New Zealanders?,Prevalence rates of cannabis use in young New Zealanders were found to be higher than previously reported. A history of unemployment or of violent behaviour was associated with more frequent cannabis use at age 21. Males were more likely than females to use cannabis frequently and to meet DSM-III-R criteria for dependence at age 21. It is suggested that drug education campaigns should specifically target young males.

"Is moderate-to-severe diabetic retinopathy more prevalent in Mexico City than in San Antonio , Texas?","Overall prevalence of DR is similar in both cities. However, moderate-to-severe DR is significantly higher in Mexico City."
Does electrophysiology and density of retinal neurons in mice with a mutation that include the Pax2 locus?,"These experiments show that the eyes of Krd mice have reduced ERGs and reduced cellular density. There is a loss of cells in all layers of the retina, but the inner layers are affected more severely. Consistent with this, the b-wave is reduced more than the a-wave. The normal functional dependency of the ERG on stimulus intensity and the normal response kinetics suggest the cellular losses are not associated with changes in cellular function."
Is endometrial integrin expression independent of estrogen or progestin treatment in vitro?,"The cellular distribution of integrin expression was similar to that described in vivo. In contrast, a steroid regulated expression could not be detected in vitro. Rather, a derepression by a factor not included in our model could be responsible for the cyclic appearance of some integrins. In endometriosis, no fundamental difference of integrin expression was detected."

"Are phobic symptoms , particularly the fear of blood and injury , associated with poor glycemic control in type I diabetic adults?","Phobic symptoms are frequent in patients with type I diabetes. The intensity of phobic symptoms and anxiety-depression negatively influences metabolic control. Increased fear of blood and injury may lead some patients to perform few home blood glucose measurements and may result in poorer glycemic control. This suggests that, by decreasing the fear of blood, injury, and injection, metabolic control may be improved."
Is cumulative incidence of childhood-onset IDDM unaffected by pertussis immunization?,"The comparison of the cumulative incidence of IDDM, up to the age of 12 years, in birth cohorts with high and low exposure to pertussis vaccine does not support the hypothesis that pertussis could induce autoimmunity to the beta-cell that may lead to IDDM."
Does continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration attenuate polymorphonuclear leukocyte phagocytosis in porcine intra-abdominal sepsis?,"Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration attenuates the upregulation of PMN phagocytosis of Candida; this effect disappears after CAVH is discontinued. Hemofiltration does not affect many other manifestations of sepsis, which implies that these manifestations may not be related to PMN phagocytosis capacity."
Do igG and IgE antibodies in subjects allergic to penicillins recognize different parts of the penicillin molecule?,Subjects who develop simultaneously IgE and IgG antibodies to penicillins show different specificities. This proves that different populations of antibodies recognize different epitopes.
Does rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm cause priming of phagocytic oxidative burst?,Rupture of an AAA resulted in priming of the phagocyte oxidant capacity before operative repair compared with elective AAA. Phagocyte activation is a critical component of the systemic inflammatory response that may contribute to the high incidence of systemic organ dysfunction and death in this patient group.

Do factors parents use in selecting play spaces for young children?,"These results indicate that parents can identify factors they use in selecting places for their young children to play, and selection factors differ somewhat by ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Further studies are needed to determine whether improvements on the most important selection factors might be effective in increasing the use of play spaces by children and their parents. Clinicians may be able to use the most highly rated decision factors to help parents assess the acceptability of play spaces in their areas."
Does percentage of free prostate-specific antigen in sera predict aggressiveness of prostate cancer a decade before diagnosis?,These data suggest that the percentage of free PSA in sera is predictive of tumor behavior at a time when total PSA levels provide no information on tumor aggressiveness. Evaluation of the percentage of free serum PSA may be helpful in making the decision between expectant management and treatment for those men who are diagnosed with early prostate cancers by PSA testing.
Does cross-talk between cell adhesion molecules regulate the migration velocity of neutrophils?,These studies show that binding of ligands to CD31 and/or P-selectin modifies the rate of integrin-supported neutrophil migration. This novel example of 'cross-talk' between surface receptors suggests that cell adhesion molecules might generally transduce accessory signals between adjacent cells to modify their migratory responses to chemotactic signals.
Do effect of prosthetic superstructure accuracy on the osteointegrated implant bone interface?,"Given the limitations of sample size, animal model used, duration of prosthetic superstructure attachment, and loading confounders possible, the study of prosthetic framework misfit must be evaluated with another animal model, such as an intraoral primate model, to determine the relationship between clinical performance and histologic findings."
Do cytokine profiles differ in newly recruited and resident subsets of mucosal macrophages from inflammatory bowel disease?,"In IBD mucosa, macrophages with a monocyte-like phenotype are primed for production of TNF-alpha and IL-1alpha/beta and may therefore be of significant pathogenic importance [corrected]. However, this CD14+ subset, as well as the mucosal resident macrophages, have preserved responsiveness to several down-regulatory factors such as the macrophage deactivators IL-10 and IL-4."
Are smokers unaware of the filter vents now on most cigarettes : results of a national survey?,Smokers are generally unaware of the presence and function of filter vents-a major design feature subject to behavioural blocking by smokers and now present on most cigarettes in the United States. Smokers and policy-makers need to be informed about the presence of filter vents and how vent blocking increases tar and nicotine yields from ostensibly very low-yield cigarettes.

Is prevalence of radiographic hip osteoarthritis increased in high bone mass?,"An increased prevalence of radiographic hip OA and osteophytosis was observed in HBM cases compared with controls, in keeping with a positive association between HBM and OA and suggesting that OA in HBM has a hypertrophic phenotype."
Does cytoplasmic SET induce tau hyperphosphorylation through a decrease of methylated phosphatase 2A?,"The presence of full-length SET in the neuronal cytoplasm is sufficient to impair PP2A methylation and activity, leading to tau hyperphosphorylation. In addition, our data suggest that tau hyperphosphorylation is regulated by different mechanisms at distinct sites. The translocation of SET to the neuronal cytoplasm, the low activity of PP2A, and tau hyperphosphorylation are associated in the brains of Alzheimer patients. Our data show a link between the translocation of SET in the cytoplasm and the decrease of methylated PP2A levels leading to a decrease of PP2A activity and tau hyperphosphorylation. This chain of events may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease."
Is [ Increased body mass index in young adults associated with metabolic syndrome ]?,"BMI change in young adults is an important risk factor for MetS among individuals in their 40s. Even subjects with a BMI lower than 25 had differences in the risk of developing MetS based on their BMI change sub-group. In the field of occupational health, it will be necessary to promote stable weight control in young adults to reduce the incidence of MetS."

While further studies to confirm these results and the functional meaning in terms of pathophysiology of GAD are needed, the potential conceptual and clinical meanings are discussed."
Does meta-epidemiologic analysis indicate that MEDLINE searches are sufficient for diagnostic test accuracy systematic reviews?,"Restricting to studies indexed on MEDLINE did not influence the summary estimates of the meta-analyses in our sample. In certain circumstances, for instance, when resources are limited, it may be appropriate to restrict searches to MEDLINE. However, the impact on individual reviews cannot be predicted."
Does patient perception of understanding health education and instructions have moderating effect on glycemic control?,Our results revealed that not only were patients with adequate health literacy associated with good glycemic control but patients with marginal health literacy were also able to achieve good glycemic control. Adequate health literacy and better understanding of health education is highly correlated. The role of adequate health literacy on glycemic control could be suppressed if variables are over-controlled during analysis.
Are measures of spontaneous and movement-evoked pain associated with disability in patients with whiplash injuries?,This study examined the degree to which measures of spontaneous and movement-evoked pain accounted for shared or unique variance in functional disability associated with whiplash injury.

Do validation of video motion-detection scoring of forced swim test in mice?,"This computer-scoring method is an effective, fast, and low-cost method of quantifying the FST. It is validated by replicating statistical differences observed in traditional visual scoring. We also demonstrate a case of heterosis in the FST."
Does whey protein modify gene expression related to protein metabolism affecting muscle weight in resistance-exercised rats?,A reduction in MAFbx gene transcription induced by whey protein and the interaction between exercise and whey protein ingestion on mTOR gene expression contributed significantly to differences in body and muscle weight gain.
Is medicaid status associated with higher surgical site infection rates after spine surgery?,The study highlights the increased cost of spine surgical procedures for patients with a Medicaid payer status with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 provisions could cause a reduction in reimbursement to the hospital for taking care of patients with Medicaid insurance due to their higher complication rates and higher costs. This very issue could inadvertently lead to access limitations.
"Are adiposity , gut microbiota and faecal short chain fatty acids linked in adult humans?","The results support the hypothesis that colonic fermentation patterns may be altered, leading to different faecal SCFA concentrations in OWOB compared with LN humans. More in-depth studies looking at the metabolic fate of SCFA produced in LN and OWOB participants are needed in order to determine the role of SCFA in obesity."

Does pedicle screw reinsertion using previous pilot hole and trajectory reduce fixation strength?,"Despite a significant reduction in pedicle screw IT, there was no significant difference in pedicle screw POS with reinsertion. Therefore, when surgeons must completely remove a pedicle screw for tract inspection, reinsertion along the same trajectory may be performed without significantly compromising fixation strength."
Do relationship between anthropometric or functional characteristics and maximal serve velocity in professional tennis players?,Height was confirmed to be the main anthropometric determinant of serves speed in professional tennis players.
Are memory deficits in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis exclusively caused by executive dysfunction : a comparative neuropsychological study of amnestic mild cognitive impairment?,"The presented results indicate that the interpretation of neuropsychological scores needs to take the distinct cognitive profiles in ALS and aMCI into consideration. Importantly, the observed memory deficits in ALS were distinctly different from those observed in aMCI and can be explained only to some extent in the context of comorbid (coexisting) executive dysfunction. These findings highlight the qualitative differences in temporal lobe dysfunction between ALS and aMCI patients, and support temporal lobe dysfunction as a mechanism underlying the distinct cognitive impairments observed in ALS."
Does a functional polymorphism of the MAOA gene modulate spontaneous brain activity in pons?,Lower spontaneous brain activity in the pons of the MAOA-L male adolescents may provide a neural mechanism by which boys with the MAOA-L genotype confers risk for impulsivity and aggression.
Does thymoquinone induce cell death in human squamous carcinoma cells via caspase activation-dependent apoptosis and LC3-II activation-dependent autophagy?,"These findings indicated that TQ induced cell death in oral cancer cells via two distinct anti-neoplastic activities that can induce apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, TQ is a promising candidate in phytochemical-based, mechanistic, and pathway-targeted cancer prevention strategies."
Are you the danger : attenuated insula response in methamphetamine users during aversive interoceptive decision-making?,"AI/IFG attenuations in METH are suggestive of an executive functioning deficit, particularly in users with low anxiety, reflecting reduced resources allocated to choice selection. In contrast, PI/ACC reductions in METH appear specific to impairments in registering and evaluating interoceptive experiences. Taken together, inadequate activation of brain areas that are important for regulating when one does not feel well may be the neural basis for poor decision-making by METH."
Are non-invasive fibrosis tests correlated with necroinflammatory actvity of liver in patients with chronic hepatitis B?,"APRI, APGA and GUCI tests may be helpful in prediction of necroinflammatory scores in the liver."
Does mRNA-Seq reveal novel molecular mechanisms and a robust fingerprint in Graves ' disease?,"These data reveal an active immune defense system in Graves' disease, which involves novel molecular mechanisms in its pathogenesis and development."
Are atherosclerotic risk factors and atherosclerotic postoperative events associated with low inflammation in abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"Low amount of inflammation in AAAs is associated with more atherosclerotic risk factors, more advanced local atherosclerotic lesions and more postoperative atherosclerotic adverse events. This observation supports the view that AAA development is a multi-factorial process in which part of the patient population has a closer relation with systemic atherosclerotic disease, while in other patients local inflammatory reactions might play a larger role."
"'s it what you think , it 's how you relate to it : dispositional mindfulness moderates the relationship between psychological distress and the cortisol awakening response?",These findings are consistent with the idea that the tendency to describe and accept experiences may buffer the impact of psychological distress on physiological arousal. These metacognitive processes may be important moderators in unraveling the complex relationship between psychological distress and physiological stress reactivity. Further research is recommended to replicate this approach in other populations.

Does use of SMS and tablet computer improve the electronic collection of elective orthopaedic patient reported outcome measures?,Collecting PROM data effectively in everyday clinical practice is challenging. Electronic collection should meet that challenge and improve healthcare delivery but it is in its infancy. This pilot study shows that the combination of an SMS reminder and access to a Wi-Fi enabled tablet computer in the clinic setting enabled 94% of patients listed for an operation to complete a score on a web-based clinical outcomes system. Additional staff training and telephone call reminders may further improve uptake.
Is low tissue oxygen saturation at emergency center triage predictive of intensive care unit admission?,"In this patient population, an StO2 less than 70% significantly increased the risk of ICU admission. Tissue oxygen saturation at triage identifies critical patients who may not be recognized by vital signs alone. Tissue oxygen saturation measurement could help providers make earlier decisions regarding hospital resource allocation."
Is parental knowledge an environmental influence on adolescent externalizing?,"In this sample of adolescents, parental knowledge exerted an environmental influence on adolescent externalizing after accounting for genetic influences of parents and adolescents. Because the association between parenting and child development originates in the parent, treatment for adolescent externalizing must not only include parents but should also focus on altering their parental style. Thus, findings suggest that teaching parents better knowledge-related monitoring strategies is likely to help reduce externalizing problems in adolescents."
Do metabolic parameters using ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT correlate with occult lymph node metastasis in squamous cell lung carcinoma?,Metabolic parameters on pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT were significant predictors for OLM in cN0 SC-NSCLC patients.

Do patients with very-late-onset schizoprhenia-like psychosis have higher mortality rates than elderly patients with earlier onset schizophrenia?,"Patients with VLOSLP, especially men, are at even higher risk of death than schizophrenia patients with earlier onset. Physical comorbidities and accidents in the VLOSLP group mostly explained this result. Targeted clinical interventions with effective collaboration between psychiatry and primary and specialist-level somatic care are crucial to reduce their excess mortality"
Does dNA barcoding work in practice but not in ( neutral ) theory?,"To our knowledge, this is the first large study of animal mitochondrial diversity using actual census population sizes and the first to test outliers for population structure. Our finding of universally low intraspecific variation contradicts a central prediction of neutral theory and is not readily accounted for by commonly proposed ad hoc modifications. We argue that the weight of evidence-low intraspecific variation and the molecular clock-indicates neutral evolution plays a minor role in mitochondrial sequence evolution. As an alternate paradigm consistent with empirical data, we propose extreme purifying selection, including at synonymous sites, limits variation within species and continuous adaptive selection drives the molecular clock."
Does the cumulative risk of false-positive screening result across screening centres in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program?,"A substantial variation in the performance measures across the screening centres in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program was identified, despite of similar administration, procedures, and quality assurance requirements.

The significant SNPs found in this study could be used in selection to increase number of teats in pigs, so that the increasing number of live-born piglets can be nursed by the sow. This study points to common genetic mechanisms regulating number of vertebrae and number of teats."
Does melatonin affect oxidative/inflammatory biomarkers in a closed-chest porcine model of acute myocardial infarction?,Melatonin treatment did not result in reduction of inflammatory or oxidative stress markers after experimental myocardial infarction compared to placebo.
Does model for End-Stage Liver Disease score predict mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients?,"Our results demonstrate that the prognostic ability of a variety of scoring systems strongly depends on the patient population. In the MICU population, each model (MELD + SOFA, MELD, and SOFA) demonstrates excellent discrimination for 28-day and 1-year mortality. However, these scoring systems did not predict 28-day mortality in the surgical ICU group but were significant for 1-year mortality. This suggests that patients admitted to a surgical ICU will behave similarly to their MICU cohort if they survive the perioperative period."
Is reduction of prothrombin and Factor V levels following supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids sex dependent : a randomised controlled study?,Significant interactions between sex and specific LCn-3PUFA exist to reduce procoagulant activity differentially in males vs. females and could have profound effects on managing risk of thrombotic disease.

Is cervical spinal cord volume loss related to clinical disability progression in multiple sclerosis?,"SC MRI parameters including baseline UCCA and SC lesions were significant MRI predictors of disease progression. Progressive 24-month upper SC atrophy occurred in all MS subtypes, and was faster in patients exhibiting disease progression at month-24."
Do sound localization abilities of unilateral hybrid cochlear implant users with bilateral low-frequency hearing?,"Best results, for most subjects, were obtained with the routinely used combined fitting. The additional acoustic stimulation of the implanted ear did not significantly improve sound localization. However, a marked improvement has been found by the addition of electrical stimulation, for especially the azimuths ipsilateral and to the front of the cochlear implant, implying the importance of the cochlear implant in sound localization."

Does smoking behaviour modify IL23r-associated disease risk in patients with Crohn 's disease?,"IL23R gene variants determine CD susceptibility in the Australian and New Zealand population, particularly ileal CD. A strong additive interaction exists between IL23R SNPs and smoking behavior resulting in a dramatic increase in disease risk depending upon specific genetic background."
Does diarrhea in young children from low-income countries lead to large-scale alterations in intestinal microbiota composition?,Our findings expand the current understanding of microbiota-associated diarrhea pathogenicity in young children from developing countries. Our findings are necessarily based on correlative analyses and must be further validated through epidemiological and molecular techniques.
Does limited evidence suggest no difference in orthodontic attachment failure rates with the acid-etch technique and self-etch primers?,"We found low quality evidence that was insufficient to conclude whether or not there is a difference in bond failure rate between SEPs and conventional etching systems when bonding fixed orthodontic appliances over a five- to 37-month follow-up. Insufficient data were also available to allow any conclusions to be formed regarding the superiority of SEPs or conventional etching for the outcomes: decalcification, participant satisfaction and cost-effectiveness, or regarding the superiority of different etching materials, concentrations or etching times, or of any one SEP over another. Further well-designed RCTs on this topic are needed to provide more evidence in order to answer these clinical questions."
Does whole exome sequencing identify a novel EMD mutation in a Chinese family with dilated cardiomyopathy?,We described a family with rare clinical presentations caused by a novel EMD deletion mutation. Our findings broaden the heterogeneous spectrum of phenotypes attributed to EMD mutations and provide new insight to explain the genotype-phenotype correlations between EMD mutations and EDMD symptoms.

Conversely, long-standing DM was associated with a later onset."
Is the risk for behavioural deficits determined by the maternal immune response to prenatal immune challenge in a neurodevelopmental model?,"The individual maternal immune response to MIA is an important determinant of the behavioural outcome in offspring, including negative symptoms such as anhedonia. We failed to find any significant difference in the level of microglia activation between Poly I:C WL, Poly I:C WG and control offspring."
Is osteocalcin higher across pregnancy in Caucasian women with gestational diabetes mellitus?,"Serum osteocalcin is elevated in Caucasian women with GDM throughout pregnancy, but was not predictive of the onset of GDM. Larger trials evaluating the role of osteocalcin and the development of GDM appear warranted."
Does antagonistic interaction between Wnt and Notch activity modulate the regenerative capacity of a zebrafish fibrotic liver model?,"Our findings not only elucidate how signaling pathways and cell-cell communications direct the cellular response of HPCs to fibrogenic stimuli, but also identify novel potential therapeutic strategies for chronic liver disease."
Is caco-2 accumulation of lutein greater from human milk than from infant formula despite similar bioaccessibility?,"These data suggest that the bioavailability of carotenoids is greater from human milk than infant formula primarily due to intestinal absorptive processes, and that absorption of lutein is potentiated by factors from human milk especially at low lutein concentration."
Does metabolomics analysis identify intestinal microbiota-derived biomarkers of colonization resistance in clindamycin-treated mice?,Recovery of colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment coincided with restoration of several fecal bacterial metabolites. These metabolites could provide useful biomarkers indicating intact or disrupted colonization resistance during and after antibiotic treatment.
Do speech reception threshold benefits in cochlear implant users with an adaptive beamformer in real life situations?,"The degree of improvement was consistent with previous beamforming studies. In the most challenging listening situation, with noise from eight speakers and speech and noise presented coincidentally from the front, UltraZoom still provided a significant benefit. When a moving noise source was added, the improvement in SRT provided by UltraZoom was maintained."
Do non-randomized controlled prospective study on perioperative levels of stress and dysautonomia during dental implant surgery?,"CgA levels were high in both groups immediately before surgery, and thus CgA values immediately before surgery may not be a reliable indicator of the need for intravenous sedation. Also, spectral analysis of HRV, especially ΔL/H and ΔCCV(HF), could be useful for assessing tension and anxiety."
Does sequencing of breast cancer stem cell populations indicate a dynamic conversion between differentiation states in vivo?,"The data presented here exclude the possibility that CSCs are only a phenotypic consequence of certain somatic mutations, that is a distinct and non-reversible population of cells. In addition, our results imply that CSCs must be a population of cells that can dynamically switch from differentiated tumor cells, and vice versa. This finding increases our understanding of CSC function in tumor heterogeneity and the importance of identifying drugs to counter de-differentiation rather than targeting CSCs."
Does valproic acid enhance the anti-tumor effect of pegylated interferon-α towards pancreatic cancer cell lines?,The combination of VPA and PEG-IFNα can be useful for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
Does leukoaraiosis predict a poor 90-day outcome after endovascular stroke therapy?,"The severity of pre-existing leukoaraiosis is independently associated with 90-day functional outcome in patients with stroke who underwent endovascular stroke therapy. These results highlight the need to further explore leukoaraiosis as a promising surrogate marker for poor outcome after endovascular stroke therapy to improve risk assessment, patient selection, and early prognostic accuracy."
Do novel immortal human cell lines reveal subpopulations in the nucleus pulposus?,"Here we report the generation of clonal NP cell lines from nondegenerate human IVD tissue and present a detailed characterization of NP cellular subpopulations. Differential cell surface marker expression and divergent responses to differentiation conditions suggest that the NP subtypes may correspond to distinct maturation stages and represent distinct NP cell subpopulations. Hence, we provide evidence that the immortalization strategy that we applied is capable of detecting cell heterogeneity in the NP. Our cell lines yield novel insights into NP biology and provide promising new tools for studies of IVD development, cell function and disease."
Does optical coherence tomography-based measurement of drusen load predict development of advanced age-related macular degeneration?,"Drusen load, as measured using SD OCT, is associated with the development of RPE atrophy and neovascular AMD. SD OCT assessments of drusen load are simple and practical measurements that may be useful in stratifying the risk of developing advanced AMD. These measurements have potential applications in both routine clinical care and clinical trials."
Do effect of antibiotics on implant failure and postoperative infection?,"Antibiotic use significantly lowered the implant failure rate (P = 0.003), with an odds ratio of 0.331, implying that antibiotic treatment reduced the odds of failure by 66.9%. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one patient from having an implant failure was 48 (95% confidence interval 31-109). In contrast, antibiotic use did not significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative infection (P = 0.754). Based on the results of this meta-analysis, and pending further research in the field, it can be concluded that there is evidence in favour of systematic antibiotic use in patients receiving dental implants, since such treatment significantly reduces implant failure. In contrast, antibiotic use does not exert a significant preventive effect against postoperative infection."
Is epicardial adipose tissue thickness associated with myocardial infarction and impaired coronary perfusion?,Increased EAT is associated with AMI and it may prove beneficial for choosing patients who would need more aggressive approach in terms of risk reduction using echocardiography which is a relatively cheap and readily available tool as a follow-up parameter.

Is long-term adenoma recurrence following wide-field endoscopic mucosal resection ( WF-EMR ) for advanced colonic mucosal neoplasia infrequent : results and risk factors in 1000 cases from the Australian Colonic EMR ( ACE ) study?,"Following colonic WF-EMR, early recurrent/residual adenoma occurs in 16%, and is usually unifocal and diminutive. Risk factors were identified. Late recurrence occurs in 4%. Overall, recurrence was managed endoscopically in 93% of cases. Recurrence is not a significant clinical problem following WF-EMR, as with strict colonoscopic surveillance, it can be managed endoscopically with high success rates."
Is sagittal component alignment less reliable than coronal component alignment in a Chinese population undergoing navigated TKA?,The sagittal component alignment of primary TKA obtained using the conventional and navigated techniques differed significantly. Navigated TKAs resulted in a higher risk of hyperextension of the femoral components in Chinese patients.
Does preoperative C-reactive protein predict the severity and likelihood of complications following appendicectomy?,A high preoperative CRP level predicts an increased rate of postoperative complication due to established inflammation and/or infection. This raises the question of whether we should be offering primary open appendicectomies to patients with a CRP level of >150 mg/l.

Does bMI modulate calorie-dependent dopamine changes in accumbens from glucose intake?,"These findings show reduced dopamine release in ventral striatum with calorie consumption in obese subjects, which might contribute to their excessive food intake to compensate for the deficit between the expected and the actual response to food consumption."
Does adult attachment status predict the developmental trajectory of maternal sensitivity in new motherhood among Chinese mothers?,"maternal sensitivity increased over time during infancy. Furthermore, individual differences existed in the developmental trajectory, which was influenced by maternal attachment status."
Does novel TBX1 loss-of-function mutation cause isolated conotruncal heart defects in Chinese patients without 22q11.2 deletion?,These observations suggest that the TBX1 loss-of-function mutation may be involved in the pathogenesis of isolated CTDs. This is the first human missense mutation showing that TBX1 is a candidate causing isolated CTDs in Chinese patients without 22q11.2 deletion.
Are chronic renal dysfunction and anaemia associated with cognitive impairment in older patients with heart failure?,Cognitive impairment is common in elderly heart failure patients and is independently associated with anaemia and renal dysfunction. Further studies are needed to assess whether optimal treatment of anaemia and CKD may prevent the development of cognitive impairment in heart failure patients.
Is concern about falling associated with step length in persons with multiple sclerosis?,The present study provides quantitative evidence establishing spatio-temporal gait performance in individuals with MS relative to the level of fear of falling.
Does radiation-free spinometry add to the predictive power of historical height loss in clinical vertebral fracture assessment?,"Our results based on a new data set suggest validity of the prognostic score published previously. In addition, although our findings did not confirm our initial hypothesis that radiation-free spinometry alone performs superior to the assessment of HHL to predict VFs, we showed that radiation-free spinometry still adds predictive power to the ability of HHL to discriminate patients with VFs."
Does ubiquinol reduce gamma glutamyltransferase as a marker of oxidative stress in humans?,"CoQ10 level is positively associated with serum GGT activity. Supplementation with Q10H2 reduces serum GGT activity. This effect might be caused by gene expression. Overall, we provide preliminary evidence that higher Q10H2 levels improve oxidative stress via reduction of serum GGT activity in humans."
Is colon capsule endoscopy a safe and useful tool to assess disease parameters in patients with ulcerative colitis?,"CCE is a safe and useful method for the evaluation of patients with UC. The ability of CCE to assess distal ileum provides an advantage to colonoscopy as CCE can identify patients who have been incorrectly diagnosed with UC, resulting in a change in their diagnosis to Crohn's disease."
Does vitamin E supplementation restore glutathione and malondialdehyde to normal concentrations in erythrocytes of type 1 diabetic children?,"Glutathione level is significantly related to vitamin E level, and supplementation with vitamin E (100 IU/day) significantly increases glutathione and lowers lipid peroxidation and HbA1c concentrations in the erythrocytes of type 1 diabetic patients."
Does evidence that the beta-catenin nuclear translocation assay allow for measuring presenilin 1 dysfunction?,"Our results further establish the nuclear translocation assay of beta-catenin as an adequate alternative for traditional Abeta measurement to evaluate the effect of PSEN1 mutations on biochemical processes. We detected no significant effect of overexpressed wt or mt PSEN1 on the stability of beta-catenin. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation between PSEN1 and GSK3beta was not observed in our experimental setup."
Do t cells recognize an immunodominant epitope of heat shock protein 65 in Kawasaki disease?,Cross-reactivity between specific epitopes of mycobacterial and human HSP could play a role in the development of the tissue-damage characteristic of KD.
Does proton MR spectroscopy detect a relative decrease of N-acetylaspartate in the medial temporal lobe of patients with AD?,Assessing the distribution of NAA/creatine reduction guided by the expected neuropathologic change can improve the role of 1H-MRS in the assessment of AD. The disease severity can be monitored by relative reduction of NAA/creatine in the MTL in comparison with an intraindividual unaffected control region.
Does callosal atrophy correlate with temporal lobe volume and mental status in Alzheimer 's disease?,"The study demonstrated that the regional morphology of the CC correlates with current cognitive status and temporal lobe atrophy in AD. As well, the lack of difference for the AC suggests that commissural atrophy in AD is regionally specific."
Do doppler microembolic signals predict ischemic recurrences in symptomatic carotid stenosis?,MES may identify patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis who are likely to suffer an ischemic recurrence before endarterectomy. This information may affect medical treatment and referral to the vascular surgeon.
Does personality correlate of glycemic control in type 2 diabetes?,Personality traits may offer new insights into variations in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing standard management. The relative tendency to experience fewer negative emotions and to focus on the needs of others instead of oneself could prove to be a risk factor for poor glycemic control.
Does marker antibody expression stratify Crohn 's disease into immunologically homogeneous subgroups with distinct clinical characteristics?,"The findings suggest that by taking into account the magnitude of the host immune response, Crohn's disease can now be stratified on an immunological basis into more homogeneous clinically distinct subgroups, characterised by greater uniformity among anatomical distribution of disease and disease behaviour."
Do nicotinic receptor pore mutations create a sensitive inhibitory site for ethanol?,"Wild-type nicotinic receptors have a very low affinity for EtOH, but only one or two mutations in the pore site create receptors inhibited by physiological EtOH concentrations. Ethanol inhibition is due primarily to channel interactions in the open state. At amino acid alpha252, side-chain hydrophobicity, not size, determines receptor sensitivity to EtOH inhibition. We propose that similar sites may exist within the pores of other EtOH-sensitive ion channels, such as NMDA receptors and neuronal nicotinic receptors."
Does granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor inhibit HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived macrophages?,"GM-CSF regulates HIV-1 replication in MDM, inhibiting HIV-1 replication through binding to the beta-chain of the GM-CSF receptor."
Do at-risk drinkers use safe ride services to avoid drinking and driving?,SR programs attract drinkers at high risk for DWI. DWI prevention efforts would benefit from future research exploring how at-risk drinkers make drinking and driving decisions.

Is synaptic targeting and localization of discs-large a stepwise process controlled by different domains of the protein?,"Postsynaptic targeting of DLG requires a HOOK-dependent association with extrasynaptic compartments, and interactions mediated by the first two PDZ domains. The GUK domain routes DLG between compartments, possibly by interacting with recently identified cytoskeletal-binding partners."
Are idiopathic senile gait disorders signs of subclinical disease?,"Senile gait disorders are related to subclinical, perhaps cardiovascular, disease. Senile gait disorders should not be accepted as an inevitable, benign concomitant of the normal aging process."
Do aryl ureas represent a new class of anti-trypanosomal agents?,The urea scaffold and the thiourea scaffold are promising leads for the development of new effective chemotherapy for trypanosomal diseases. Libraries of compounds of both scaffolds need to be synthesized and screened against a series of homologous parasitic cysteine proteases to optimize the potency of the initial leads.
Does alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency-associated liver disease progress slowly in some children?,"These data provide further evidence for the variable severity of liver disease associated with alpha1-AT deficiency and indicate that some patients have chronic, slowly progressing or nonprogressing cirrhosis."
Does intensity of acute exercise affect serum leptin concentrations in young men?,"We conclude that 30 min of acute exercise, at varying intensity of exercise and caloric expenditure, does not affect serum leptin concentrations during exercise or for the first 3.5 hours of recovery in healthy young men."
Do the influence of residual high-frequency hearing on the outcome in congenitally deaf cochlear implant recipients?,Implant recipients aged 10 to 15 years experience more difficulty than younger children during the initial periods of device use. A history of high-frequency hearing before implantation in these individuals correlates with more rapid improvement.
Do multifocal electroretinogram abnormalities persist following resolution of central serous chorioretinopathy?,"Both eyes of patients with active unilateral CSC exhibit diminished MERG amplitudes. Although MERG response amplitudes increased modestly after recovery from CSC, they remained statistically subnormal throughout the posterior pole of both eyes. These findings support the theory that subretinal fluid retention in CSC is secondary to diffuse pathologic changes in the choroid and/or retinal pigment epithelium. They also suggest that the underlying or predisposing abnormalities of CSC resolved only partially in our patients. Components of the MERG may have value as a prognostic tool for judging the risk of developing symptomatic CSC. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:1211-1215"
Do hippocampal neurons express GABA A receptor insensitive to diazepam in hyperexcitable conditions?,Hippocampal dentate granule cells express DZP-insensitive receptors in hyperexcitable states. These receptors are likely to contain alpha4 subunit.
Does zonisamide reduce the increase in 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels formed during iron-induced epileptogenesis in the brains of rats?,"These results indicate that the formation of iron-induced epileptogenic foci in rats is related to DNA-damage-induced reactive oxygen species and that the inhibition of 8-OHdG formation by ZNS after iron injection may be due to the drug's antioxidant activity. The data suggest that free radical species known to be formed during iron salts-induced focal epileptogenesis cause damage to isocortical DNA. Furthermore, ZNS appears to inhibit the focal injuring response to DNA that occurs following iron salts-induced acute epileptogenesis."
Do serum androgens return to normal after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery in men?,Successful temporal lobe epilepsy surgery may lead to a normalization of serum androgen concentrations in men with epilepsy.
Does 7-nitroindazole differentially affect the anticonvulsant activity of antiepileptic drugs against amygdala-kindled seizures in rats?,Pharmacokinetic interactions do not seem to account for the anticonvulsant effects of 7-NI combined with CBZ or PB. Central nitric oxide (NO) is possibly not involved in the synergism between 7-NI and these AEDs.
Do impaired glucose tolerance and fasting hyperglycaemia have different characteristics?,"In those with milder degrees of glucose intolerance, FH is associated with beta cell dysfunction and those with IGT and a relatively 'normal' fasting glucose have features of the insulin resistance syndrome."
Are autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase sensitive serological parameters for detecting silent coeliac disease in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus?,"These data show that a positive IgA antibody test to tTG is a more sensitive parameter than EmA for silent coeliac disease in patients with diabetes. Confirmatory small bowel biopsy, however, remains necessary for diagnosis as some patients with positive antibodies may be without histological changes."
Is normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass beneficial for cognitive brain function after coronary artery bypass grafting -- a prospective randomized trial?,"Objective cognitive P300 auditory evoked potential measurements indicate, that subclinical impairment of cognitive brain function is more pronounced in patients undergoing mildly hypothermic CPB as compared with normothermic CPB for CABG."
Is maternal diet rich in saturated fat during breastfeeding associated with atopic sensitization of the infant?,Our results show that an unbalanced maternal diet during breastfeeding may be a risk factor underlying the later development of atopic sensitization of the infant regardless of maternal atopic disease. The observation thus extends findings implying that early nutrition programmes the subsequent health of the child to the risk of developing atopic disease.

Does human cytomegalovirus cause productive infection and neuronal injury in differentiating fetal human central nervous system neuroepithelial precursor cells?,"Neuroepithelial precursor cells and differentiating astrocytes and neurons are permissive to cytopathic HCMV infection, suggesting that the fetal human central nervous system is vulnerable to HCMV-induced neuronal injury at its earliest stages of development."
Is a polymorphism in the cystatin C gene a novel risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer 's disease?,"The reduced or absent risk for AD conferred by APOE in older populations has been well reported in the literature, prompting the suggestion that additional genetic risk factors confer risk for later-onset AD. In the author's dataset the opposite effects of APOE and CST3 genotype on risk for AD with increasing age suggest that CST3 is one of the risk factors for later-onset AD. Although the functional significance of this coding polymorphism has not yet been reported, several hypotheses can be proposed as to how variation in an amyloidogenic cysteine protease inhibitor may have pathologic consequences for AD."
Does urea kinetic analysis of automated peritoneal dialysis allow calculation of a CAPD-equivalent Kt/V ( urea )?,"The APD urea clearance, which provides urea mass removal equivalent to CAPD, varies as a function of a combination of patient and treatment variables. However, a CAPD-equivalent weekly Kt/Vurea can be calculated by collecting appropriate dialysis and urine samples and estimating patient V. The results can be evaluated in the context of evidence-based CAPD guidelines, increasing the precision of adjustment and monitoring of the APD prescription."

Is per-operative frozen section examination of pelvic nodes unnecessary for the majority of clinically localized prostate cancers in the prostate-specific antigen era?,The incidence of unsuspected lymph node metastases has been significantly decreased in the PSA era. Frozen section examination of pelvic nodes can be omitted and radical prostatectomy is an acceptable choice of treatment in patients without macroscopically apparent nodal metastases.
Does painting Qa-2 onto Ped slow preimplantation embryos increase the rate of cleavage?,"GPI-linked Qa-2 protein ""painted"" onto both T cells and preimplantation embryos is functional, as shown by increased proliferation of T cells after cross-linking with anti-Qa-2 antibody, and increased rate of cleavage division of the embryos."
Is the use of human ultralente limited by great intraindividual variability in overnight plasma insulin profiles?,"Human ultralente insulin gives an insulin profile suitable for overnight substitution, but the great day-to-day variability limits its usefulness. It can be injected before dinner or at bedtime without any change in the insulin profile during the night."

Do proinflammatory cytokines inhibit the expression and function of human type I 5'-deiodinase in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells?,"IL-1beta inhibited both 5'DI enzyme and promoter activity and, thus, may exert its effect on thyroid hormone metabolism at least partially through direct inhibition of hepatic 5'DI gene transcription."
Is primary pulmonary hypertension associated with reduced pulmonary vascular expression of type II bone morphogenetic protein receptor?,"The cellular localization of BMPR-II is consistent with a role in the formation of pulmonary vascular lesions in PPH, and reduced BMPR-II expression may contribute to the process of vascular obliteration in severe pulmonary hypertension."
"Is transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting superior to endoscopic variceal band ligation for prevention of variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients : a randomized , controlled trial?","TIPS is not superior to VBL in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. Furthermore, similar mortality rates in patients treated with TIPS or VBL negate TIPS as the preferred strategy for prevention of variceal rebleeding."
Is mELD score better than Child-Pugh score in predicting 3-month survival of patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt?,"MELD score is superior to Child-Pugh score as predictor of short-term outcome after TIPS. Its accuracy, however, decreases for long-term predictions."
Does postoperative persistent thyrotrophin releasing hormone-induced growth hormone release predict recurrence in patients with acromegaly?,"To our knowledge this is the first report which addresses the value of early postoperative TRH-induced GH responsiveness in predicting late surgical outcome using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves to redefine a postoperative paradoxical response instead of arbitrarily chosen criteria. An absolute postoperative GH response of more than 3.75 mU/l was associated with recurrence in all nine patients, while all 32 patients with normalization of previously paradoxical response are still in remission. Our findings from this study demonstrate that the TRH test is a valuable tool in the early identification of patients at risk of developing postoperative recurrence of acromegaly."
Do recent outcomes and perspectives of the application of bone morphogenetic proteins in implant dentistry?,The number of studies in the field of dental implantology in which BMPs have been used is still too small for establishing clinical protocols of their use in order to improve a recipient bone bed prior to implant placement or to enhance the integration process of an implant.
Does treatment of iron deficiency in goitrous children improve the efficacy of iodized salt in Côte d'Ivoire?,Iron supplementation improves the efficacy of iodized salt in goitrous children with iron deficiency. A high prevalence of iron deficiency among children in areas of endemic goiter may reduce the effectiveness of iodine prophylaxis.
Does marginal iron deficiency without anemia impair aerobic adaptation among previously untrained women?,Our findings strongly suggest that iron deficiency without anemia but with elevated sTfR status impairs aerobic adaptation among previously untrained women and that this can be corrected with iron supplementation.
Is angiotensin converting enzyme inhibiting therapy associated with lower vitreous vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy?,"Treatment with ACE-inhibitors attenuates retinal overexpression of VEGF-A in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, probably by interference with a local effect of angiotensin II."

Is erbB2 expression correlated with increased survival of patients with osteosarcoma?,"In patients with high-grade osteosarcoma without metastatic disease at presentation and treated with surgery and chemotherapy, the presence of increased levels of ErbB2 in tumor cells is associated with a significantly increased probability of event-free and overall survival. Further data are needed before this marker can be used in making clinical decisions."
Does tP53 genotype but not p53 immunohistochemical result predict response to preoperative short-term radiotherapy in rectal cancer?,"The authors show that downstaging after short-term radiation may occur but is seen in tumors with normal p53 gene only. Moreover, p53 genotype but not p53 immunohistochemistry is predictive for response to preoperative short-term radiotherapy and patient survival."
Does non-invasive amino acid turnover predict human embryo developmental capacity?,"Non-invasive amino acid profiling has the potential to select developmentally competent single embryos for transfer, thereby increasing the success rate and eliminating multiple births in IVF."
Do prediction of aggression on a locked psychiatric admissions ward?,"Although a body of evidence indicates that unaided clinical prediction of violent recidivism after hospital discharge does not perform well, it may be quite accurate in estimating short-term aggression risks during acute psychiatric admission."
Is an emergency department observation unit protocol for acute-onset atrial fibrillation feasible?,Selected patients with AAF for whom initial ED management fails can subsequently be managed in an EDOU with a high short-term conversion and discharge rate.
Is cyclooxygenase-2 expression increased in early intestinal-type gastric cancer and gastric mucosa with intestinal metaplasia?,"COX-2 expression may be associated with the carcinogenesis of the intestinal type gastric cancer and, speculatively, inhibition of COX-2 might have preventative effects on the intestinal type gastric cancer."

Is platelet-derived growth factor-AA-mediated functional angiogenesis in the rat epigastric island flap after genetic modification of fibroblasts ischemia dependent?,"After retroviral gene transfer, isogenic rat fibroblasts produce high amounts of PDGF-AA in vitro. In vivo, PDGF-AA can be detected in flaps receiving genetically modified fibroblasts, which suggests survival of the implanted fibroblasts in this model. PDGF-AA produced by GMFB can induce flap angiogenesis only under ischemic conditions in this model. Transplantation of PDGF-AA-overexpressing fibroblasts results in higher flap survival in this model."
"Is circadian cycling of the mouse liver transcriptome , as revealed by cDNA microarray , driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus?","Temporally complex, circadian programming of the transcriptome in a peripheral organ is imposed across a wide range of core cellular functions and is dependent on an interaction between intrinsic, tissue-specific factors and extrinsic regulation by the SCN central pacemaker."
Does aberrant expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and killer inhibitory receptors induce immune tolerance in women with pelvic endometriosis?,Properties of macrophages and NK cells in women with endometriosis promote immunotolerance to implanted tissue in the peritoneal environment. Increased KIR(+)NK cells in peripheral blood may represent a risk factor for endometriosis.
"Is dienogest as effective as triptorelin in the treatment of endometriosis after laparoscopic surgery : results of a prospective , multicenter , randomized study?",Dienogest is as effective as Decapeptyl for consolidation therapy after surgery for the treatment of endometriosis. The safety profile of dienogest differed from Decapeptyl (3.75 mg). Dienogest constitutes a new therapeutic alternative to the GnRH analogues.

Do outcomes and service use among homeless persons with serious mental illness and substance abuse?,"Homeless persons with dual diagnoses had poorer adjustment on most baseline measures and experienced significantly less clinical improvement than those without dual diagnoses. However, those with dual diagnoses who received extensive substance abuse treatment showed improvement similar to those without at 12 months."
Does normobaric hyperoxia reduce MRI diffusion abnormalities and infarct size in experimental stroke?,"In rats subjected to transient stroke, 100% oxygen administered within 30 minutes salvages ischemic brain tissue, especially in the cerebral cortex. Reducing the time to treatment enhances the degree of neuroprotection."
Do immunohistochemically detected hepatic micrometastases predict a high risk of intrahepatic recurrence after resection of colorectal carcinoma liver metastases?,Immunohistochemical detection of hepatic micrometastases is feasible in patients with colorectal carcinoma liver metastases. Hepatic micrometastasis indicates widespread hepatic involvement and thus predicts an increased risk of intrahepatic recurrence after hepatic resection and a poorer patient prognosis.
Do asymmetric funnel plots and publication bias in meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy?,"Further research is required to explain why smaller studies tended to report greater test accuracy in a large proportion of meta-analyses of diagnostic tests. In systematic reviews of diagnostic studies, literature search should be sufficiently comprehensive and possible impact of publication bias should be assessed."
Does exercise training in obesity lower blood pressure independent of weight change?,"These data suggest that exercise training, in the absence of differences in body weight, may be useful in the reduction of obesity-induced hypertension but that other therapies may be needed in order to control other cardiovascular risk factors."
Does tumor localization and image registration of F-18 FDG coincidence detection scan with computed tomographic scans?,"Although the use of F-18 FDG CD shows great promise for the identification of tumors, it shares the same drawbacks as those associated with radiolabeled monoclonal antibody SPECT and ligand-based positron emission tomographic scans in that anatomic markers are limited. This study shows that image registration is feasible and may improve the clinical relevance of CD images."
Do normal and chronic phase CML hematopoietic cells repopulate NOD/SCID bone marrow with different kinetics and cell lineage representation?,"We conclude that in contrast to normal cell engraftment, engraftment of CML cells in NOD/SCID mice is characterized by a slow but progressive myeloid infiltration, which eventually consists almost entirely of mast cells."
Does analysis of the relationship between nurse influence over flexible working and commitment to nursing?,"The opportunity to explore quantitatively the effects of shift-related decisions on commitment using a large sample is useful. While influence and shift type were predictors of commitment, the positive impact they were expected to have was smaller than expected. Similarly, the negative effects of not having influence or of working permanent night shifts were smaller than expected and the statistical significance of such small effects relies heavily on the large sample obtained. Other variables, particularly career development prospects, outweigh the influence of shift-related variables on commitment. The research gives a clear message to human resource managers involved with nurse management: so long as nurses have a strong perception of career development potential the otherwise negative influences of shift impact can be minimized."
Are slow cortical potentials in migraine families associated with psychosocial factors?,This study provides significant evidence for a strong influence of family interactions on the development and maintenance of neurophysiological abnormalities in the migraineous headache. The role of psychosocial factors in the etiopathogenesis of migraine has to be investigated in further studies in more detail.

Further studies may enable public health groups to more accurately evaluate the future risks of hay fever and respiratory diseases (eg, asthma) exacerbated by allergenic pollen, and to develop strategies to mitigate them."
Does greater pupillary escape differentiate central from peripheral visual field loss?,"Afferent neurons from the central retina normally contribute a substantial component to the sustained pupil response. Eyes with central field loss can be distinguished from eyes with peripheral field loss by a relatively greater loss of the sustained response, causing greater pupil escape. This study showed that pupil movements in response to a nonperimetric full-field light stimulus may provide some degree of mapping of retinotopic sensitivity. This information may be of use in interpreting the pupillary movements during the swinging flashlight test and may help predict the pattern of visual field loss."
Do intraspinal implants of fibrin glue containing glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor promote dorsal root regeneration into spinal cord?,"Our results indicate that GDNF enhances regeneration of DR into the adult rat spinal cord and that GDNF may be effectively supplied to the intraspinal injury site via FG. Because the regenerated axons establish synapses on intraspinal neurons, this therapeutic strategy has the potential to help to rebuild spinal reflex circuits interrupted by spinal cord injury."
Does proton MR spectroscopic imaging predict lesion progression on MRI in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy?,Multislice proton MRS imaging is able to identify impending or beginning degeneration in white matter that still appears normal on conventional MRI. Multislice proton MRSI may be a suitable technique for the prediction of lesion progression on MRI in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.
Does transvaginal ultrasound-guided embryo transfer improve outcome in patients with previous failed in vitro fertilization cycles?,Transvaginal ultrasound-guided ET may be responsible for successful IVF cycles in patients who had previously failed to conceive when embryos were transferred by the clinical touch method. Transvaginal ultrasound guidance may also be responsible for an overall increase in embryo implantation and pregnancy compared to the use of the clinical touch method.
Do chronic ethanol treatment and withdrawal alter ACPD-evoked calcium signals in developing Purkinje neurons?,"These results show that prolonged ethanol exposure and early withdrawal lead to alterations in mGluR-evoked Ca2+ signaling in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Metabotropic GluRs in the Purkinje neuron play important roles in cerebellar development and function, suggesting that alterations of mGluR signaling pathways by ethanol may play a key role in the actions of ethanol on the developing cerebellum."
Is coronary flow velocity reserve after percutaneous interventions predictive of periprocedural outcome?,"A low postprocedural CFVR was associated with a worse periprocedural outcome (which was related to microcirculatory disturbances), but there was no significant difference at late follow-up."
Is in vivo temperature heterogeneity of atherosclerotic plaques determined by plaque composition?,In vivo temperature heterogeneity of rabbit atherosclerotic plaques is determined by plaque composition. In vivo thermography may have important clinical implications in the assessment of plaque composition.

Are two propofol formulations equivalent in small children aged 1 month to 3 years?,"The two 1% propofol formulations were equally effective in our patient population of infants and young children between 1 month and 3 years of age. No differences between the two propofol formulations were found with regard to the circulatory reaction, lipid metabolism, dosages, and recovery profile in the studied age groups."
Do major carotid plaque surface irregularities correlate with neurologic symptoms?,"Surface irregularities were revealed by means of submillimeter resolution of the carotid plaques with MRI to be common, but only the presence of major irregularities correlated with the patient having TIA or stroke. Lumen shape and plaque location did not appear to predict stroke risk, but may effect imaging accuracy in determining the degree of stenosis. These data further define the relationship of plaque irregularity and cerebrovascular symptoms caused by atheroemboli."
Is cystatin C a more sensitive marker than creatinine for the estimation of GFR in type 2 diabetic patients?,Cystatin C may be considered as an alternative and more accurate serum marker than serum creatinine or the Cockcroft and Gault estimated GFR in discriminating type 2 diabetic patients with reduced GFR from those with normal GFR.
Does choroid plexectomy reduce neurosurgical intervention in patients with hydranencephaly?,"In our experience, choroid plexectomy in patients with hydranencephaly reduces the incidence of reoperation and readmission, the number of days of hospitalization related to the surgical procedure and the total number of complications in comparison to patients undergoing CSF diversion. Further neurosurgical intervention is minimized as is the financial burden from multiple emergency department visits and radiological procedures for shunt evaluation. Choroid plexectomy is a viable alternative to CSF diversion in patients with hydranencephaly and a rapidly enlarging head. It avoids the chronic issues and complications surrounding CSF diversion in this difficult group of patients."
Do psoriatic lesional keratinocytes promote the maturation of human monocyte-derived Langerhans cells?,"Human monocyte-derived LCs cultured with supernatants from psoriatic lesional keratinocytes displayed the characteristics of maturation. This suggests that psoriatic lesional keratinocytes might secrete some factors that could promote the maturation of LCs, which may play important roles in immune reactions related to psoriasis."
Do effect of necrotic tissue on progressive injury in deep partial thickness burn wounds?,"This study suggests that the presence of necrotic tissue could be the inhibitory factor in the wound healing process, as it might cause tissue progressive injury leading to the delay of wound healing. To promote wound healing, active tangential excision is recommended to remove necrotic tissue."
Are ethnic survival differences after gastrectomy for gastric cancer better explained by factors specific for disease location and individual patient comorbidity?,"Obvious survival differences after gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma favouring Asian and Hispanic patients in this experience can be explained by different disease patterns (distal location), the related need for fewer extensive procedures (such as total gastrectomy), and diminished patient risks (tobacco, prior operations, non-cancer deaths). Our therapeutic approach remains an aggressive gastrectomy/lymphadenectomy combination for potentially curable gastric cancer, irrespective of ethnic patient factors."
Is eating disorder symptomatology associated with pregnancy and perinatal complications in a cohort of adolescents who were born preterm?,"These results indicate that traumatic episodes early in life, including brain insults, do not appear to increase the susceptibility of developing eating disorder symptomatology, depression, deficiency of self-esteem, or distortion of body shape during late adolescence."

Radiographs are needed to evaluate the condition of a dental implant and to detect critical marginal bone changes surrounding dental implants at an early stage.
Do patients with erythrophobia ( fear of blushing ) show abnormal autonomic regulation in mental stress conditions?,This study provides evidence for abnormal autonomic functioning in patients with erythrophobia when under mental stress.
"Is igE-mediated allergy to corn : a 50 kDa protein , belonging to the Reduced Soluble Proteins , a major allergen?","SPT and CAP-FEIA positivities to corn flour had no clinical significance for most of the patients and food allergy to corn has to be proved by DBPCFC. A salt-unextractable protein of 50 kDa, belonging to the RSP fraction, represents a potential allergen in food hypersensitivity to corn because of its stability to cooking and digestion."
Is diabetic family history an isolated risk factor for gestational diabetes after 30 years of age?,The risk of glucose intolerance in young women with positive family history is similar to that in the background pregnant population. Standard oral glucose tolerance test may not be necessary in this group of women if selective screening policy is adopted.
Is an early ( sixth-hour ) serum bilirubin measurement useful in predicting the development of significant hyperbilirubinemia and severe ABO hemolytic disease in a selective high-risk population of newborns with ABO incompatibility?,"The reticulocyte count, a positive direct antiglobulin test, and the presence of a sibling with neonatal jaundice were determined to be the good predictors for the development of significant hyperbilirubinemia and severe hemolytic disease of the newborn. A serum bilirubin measurement and the use of the critical bilirubin levels of 4 mg/dL and 6 mg/dL at the sixth hour of life will predict nearly all newborns who will have significant hyperbilirubinemia and those who will develop severe hemolytic disease of the newborn, respectively. An hour (age)-specific percentile-based nomogram can be used to predict which newborn is at high risk (> or =90th percentile), intermediate risk (35th-90th percentiles), and low risk (<35th percentile) for developing significant hyperbilirubinemia. The 35th and 90th percentile tracks, approximating the serum bilirubin levels of 3.3 mg/dL and 6.5 mg/dL at the sixth hour of life, respectively, can be used as safe risk demarcators in deciding about the time of discharge of ABO-incompatible newborns from the hospital."
Does poor readability of written asthma management plan found in national guidelines?,"WAMPs presented as part of the national guidelines are not written at or below a fifth-grade reading level. However, it is clear from this study that it is possible to achieve this level of readability. Increasing the availability and use of plans that meet recognized readability standards may help to improve asthma outcomes, especially in poor populations in which there is both low literacy and the greatest prevalence and severity of asthma."
Does exercise augment the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of binge eating?,"Eighty-four women completed the 16-month study. Subjects who received CBT with exercise experienced significant reductions in binge eating frequency compared with subjects who received CBT only. The CBT with exercise and maintenance group had a 58% abstinence rate at the end of the study period and an average reduction of 2.2 body mass index (BMI) units (approximately 14 lb). BMI was significantly reduced in the subjects in both the exercise and maintenance conditions. The results suggest that adding exercise to CBT, and extending the duration of treatment, enhances outcome and contributes to reductions in binge eating and BMI."
Does inhalation of fine particulate air pollution and ozone cause acute arterial vasoconstriction in healthy adults?,Short-term inhalation of fine particulate air pollution and ozone at concentrations that occur in the urban environment causes acute conduit artery vasoconstriction.
Does receptivity to alcohol marketing predict initiation of alcohol use?,Alcohol advertising and promotions are associated with the uptake of drinking. Prevention programs may reduce adolescents' receptivity to alcohol marketing by limiting their exposure to alcohol ads and promotions and by increasing their skepticism about the sponsors' marketing tactics.
Does 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography influence management decisions in patients with biliary cancer?,"Most biliary tract cancers are (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose avid tumors. In patients with potentially resectable tumors based on conventional imaging, PET identified occult metastatic disease and changed management in nearly one-fourth of all patients. PET also helped confirm recurrent cancer after resection."
Is peri-coronary epicardial adipose tissue related to cardiovascular risk factors and coronary artery calcification in post-menopausal women?,EAT is strongly related to vascular risk factors and coronary calcification. Our findings support the hypothesis that EAT affects coronary atherosclerosis and possibly coronary risk.

Does the rostral anterior cingulate cortex modulate the efficiency of amygdala-dependent fear learning?,"Our results suggest that a subregion of the rACC is key to gating the efficiency of amygdala-dependent auditory fear conditioning learning. Because r(Amy)-ACC inputs were confirmed to be glutamatergic, we propose that recruitment of this brain area might modulate overall basolateral amygdala excitatory tone during conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus concomitant processing. In the light of clinical research, our results provide new insight on the effect of inappropriate rACC recruitment during emotional events."
Is capsule endoscopy useful and safe for small-bowel surveillance in familial adenomatous polyposis?,CE is useful and safe for the surveillance of jejunal-ileal polyps in selected patients with FAP. CE is not useful in the surveillance of the duodenum where the majority of small-bowel cancers occur.

Does long-term levetiracetam treatment affect reproductive endocrine function in female Wistar rats?,Our findings indicate a possible effect of LEV on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and ovarian morphology in non-epileptic rats. The effects differ from those previously described for other AEDs. Caution must be taken before these results can be applied to humans.
Does locomotor adaptation to a powered ankle-foot orthosis depend on control method?,"These results provide evidence that the choice of orthosis control method can greatly alter how humans adapt to powered orthosis assistance during walking. Specifically, proportional myoelectric control results in larger reductions in muscle activation and gait kinematics more similar to normal compared to footswitch control."
Is social complexity in bees sufficient to explain lack of reversions to solitary living over long time scales?,"We argue that allodapine sociality has been maintained by ecological constraints and the benefits of alloparental care, as opposed to behavioural, genetic or morphological constraints to independent living. Allodapine brood are highly vulnerable to predation because they are progressively reared in an open nest (not in sealed brood cells), which provides potentially large benefits for alloparental care and incentives for reproductives to tolerate potential alloparents. We argue that similar vulnerabilities may also help explain the lack of reversions to solitary living in other taxa with ancient social origins."
Does sublingual grass allergen tablet immunotherapy provide sustained clinical benefit with progressive immunologic changes over 2 years?,Grass allergen tablet immunotherapy showed progressive immunologic changes and highly significant efficacy over 2 years of continued treatment.
Do plasma cytokine and endotoxin levels correlate with survival in patients with the sepsis syndrome?,"Patients with the sepsis syndrome have detectable levels of circulating TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and lipopolysaccharide independent of culture-documented infection. Lipopolysaccharide and cytokines may play a pathogenic role in sepsis, and the combination of several elevated factors may be important in determining patient survival."
"Is nPC 15669 , an inhibitor of neutrophil recruitment , efficacious in acetic acid-induced colitis in rats?",NPC 15669 may be useful in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.
Is the pituitary-adrenal glucocorticoid response altered by gender and disease?,This study demonstrated that the pituitary-adrenal response to oCRH in the elderly is gender specific and chronic stable disease (DM and HBP) is associated with altered regulation of the adrenal glucocorticoid response.

Is mutation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene a feature of endometrial hyperplasias?,"Because it does not appear to be a feature of endometrial hyperplasias, mutation of the p53 gene may represent a relatively late event in endometrial carcinogenesis."
Is herpes simplex virus type 1 transcription detectable in quiescent human stromal keratitis by in situ hybridization?,"At the level of detection afforded by in situ hybridization, HSV persistent in scarred human corneas after stromal keratitis appears to be transcriptionally dormant. This contrasts with the situation in neurons of latently infected sensory ganglia, in which LATs are present at high levels."
Is the pattern of the luteinizing hormone surge in spontaneous cycles related to the probability of conception?,The pattern of the LH surge in patients with cervical factor infertility is related to the outcome of a treatment with AIH.
Does the effect of the articulator settings on the cusp incline as measured by a coordinate measuring machine?,The coordinate measuring machine is useful for making measurements of articulator movements. Additional research may measure the movements of other articulators or compare articulators (such as the arcon and nonarcon).
Does low dose iron supplementation cover the need for iron during pregnancy?,"Despite a normal hemoglobin concentration and intact iron stores in the 16th week, an iron supplementation of 18 mg daily is not sufficient to cover the iron need in many pregnant women in the 3rd trimester."
Is prevalence of Celiac Disease Increased in ADHD Sample?,"In our sample of children and teenagers with ADHD, the prevalence of CD was not higher than in the general population. On the basis of the obtained results and the results of similar studies, we conclude that there are not enough data to support screening for CD and the introduction of a gluten-free diet in children with ADHD unless there are additional indications."
Do surface-engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae displaying α-acetolactate decarboxylase from Acetobacter aceti ssp xylinum?,"Since modification of yeasts with ALDC variants did not affect their fermentation performance, the display of α-acetolactate decarboxylase activity is an effective approach to decrease the formation of diacetyl during beer fermentation."

Is sarcopenia associated with albuminuria independently of hypertension and diabetes : KNHANES 2008-2011?,"Sarcopenia was associated with an increased risk of albuminuria independent of hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Sarcopenia and obesity had a synergistic impact on the increased risk of albuminuria. This suggests that sarcopenic obesity as well as sarcopenia alone may be considered as novel risk factors for albuminuria."
Does [ Combination of triptolide with sodium cantharidinate synergistically enhance apoptosis on hepatoma cell line 7721 ]?,"Triptolide and sodium cantharidinate exert a synergistic toxic effect on hepatoma cell line 7721, which is related to increasing capase-3 activity and suppression of NF- κB."
Do regulatory SNPs Alter the Gene Expression of Diabetic Retinopathy Associated Secretary Factors?,Our data proposed rs2010963-C altered the expression level of VEGFA in different tissues. We suggested small increase but long term exposure to VEGFA may lead to DR finally.
Does population-specific single-nucleotide polymorphism confer increased risk of venous thromboembolism in African Americans?,"We found a variant, PROS1 V510M, in an African American family with VTE and clinical laboratory abnormalities in Protein S. Additionally, we found that this variant conferred increased risk of VTE in a case-control study of African Americans. In the ESP cohort, the variant is nearly absent in ESP European descent subjects (n = 3, allele frequency: 0.03%). Additionally, in 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data, the variant only appears in African descent populations. Thus, PROS1 V510M is a population-specific genetic risk factor for VTE in African Americans."
Does the ACE Gene be Associated with Late-Life Major Depression and Age at Dementia Onset in a Population-Based Cohort?,"In this population-based sample of older individuals, genetic variations in ACE seem to be important both for late-life major depression and dementia."
Is a novel RYR2 loss-of-function mutation ( I4855M ) associated with left ventricular non-compaction and atypical catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia?,"This study identifies a potentially lethal overlapping syndrome of LVNC and atypical CPVT related to a novel RYR2 variant. Structural and functional studies suggest that this is a loss-of-function mutation, which exerts a dominant-negative effect on wild type RyR2."
Is n-Terminal Pro-B Type Natriuretic Peptide Associated with Mild Cognitive Impairment in the General Population?,"Within normal ranges and without manifest heart failure, higher NT-proBNPlevels are associated with MCI and both MCI subtypes independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and sociodemographic parameters."
Does the direct costs of fatal and non-fatal fall among older adults - United States?,"Medically treated falls among older adults, especially among older women, are associated with substantial economic costs."
Are carriers of a VEGFA enhancer polymorphism selectively binding CHOP/DDIT3 predisposed to increased circulating levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone?,"VEGF is an important angiogenic signal required for tissue expansion. We show that VEGFA variation giving allele-specific response to transcription factors with overlapping binding sites associate closely with circulating TSH levels. Because CHOP is induced by several types of intracellular stress, this indicates that cellular stress could be involved in the normal or pathophysiological response of the thyroid to TSH."
Is cEP78 mutated in a distinct type of Usher syndrome?,"Our results provide evidence that CEP78 is a novel disease-causing gene for Usher syndrome, demonstrating an additional link between ciliopathy and Usher protein network in photoreceptor cells and inner ear hair cells."
Are low cardiac index and stroke volume on admission associated with poor outcome in critically ill burn patients : a retrospective cohort study?,Low initial SV and CI were associated with poor outcome in critically ill burn patients. Very early hemodynamic monitoring may in help detecting under-resuscitated patients. Future prospective interventional studies should explore the impact of early goal-directed therapy in these specific patients.
Is magnetic resonance imaging-detected inflammation associated with functional disability in early arthritis-results of a cross-sectional study?,"MRI-detected inflammation, and tenosynovitis in particular, is associated with functional disability. This demonstrates the functional relevance of MRI-detected inflammation in early arthritis."
Does impaired Communication Between the Motor and Somatosensory Homunculus be Associated With Poor Manual Dexterity in Autism Spectrum Disorder?,"These findings suggest that direct interaction between S1 and M1 may contribute to the human ability to precisely interact with and manipulate the environment. Because electrophysiological evidence indicates that these connections may underpin long-term potentiation in M1, our findings may lead to novel therapeutic treatments for motor skill disorders."
"Is skeletal Muscle Quality Associated with Worse Survival After Pancreatoduodenectomy for Periampullary , Nonpancreatic Cancer?","Skeletal muscle quality, but not muscle mass, predicted survival and major complications after PD for periampullary, nonpancreatic cancer. Preoperative CT-derived body composition measures may stratify patients into risk categories and support shared decision making."

Is celiac Disease Misdiagnosed Based on Serology Only in a Substantial Proportion of Patients?,"A significant proportion of CeD patients are diagnosed by nongastroenterologists. Under the diagnostic lead of the latter, more than a third of the patients receive their diagnosis on the basis of a positive serology and/or genetics only, in evident violation of current diagnostic guidelines, which may lead to an overdiagnosis of this entity."
Does next-generation sequencing add value to the preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cysts?,"The detection of KRAS/GNAS variants improves the identification of mucinous neoplasms. Variants in TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, and NOTCH1 support the diagnosis of a high-risk cyst requiring surgery or additional sampling. Although molecular analysis is not a replacement for cytopathology, it does provide valuable information for accurate preoperative diagnosis, helping to classify mucinous neoplasms and high-risk cysts that require surgical resection.

Do intracranial EEG seizure onset-patterns correlate with high-frequency oscillations in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy?,"We demonstrated that distinct seizure-onset patterns correlate specific interictal and ictal HFO profiles confirming that seizures with different morphological patterns likely have different mechanisms of generation. This study emphazises that, in clinical practice, seizure-onset patterns should be distinguished and specified when analyzing HFOs, particularly if they are used in presurgical evaluation to better localize the seizure-onset zone."
Do mammographic extent of microcalcifications and oestrogen receptor expression affect preoperative breast carcinoma in situ size estimation?,Risk of over- or underestimation of DCIS size through MEM measurement depends on DCIS ER expression and MEM itself. Identifying which patients are at a significant risk of over- or underestimation could help the breast surgeon when discussing the surgical options with the patient.
Do low health literacy and psychological symptoms potentially increase the risks of non-suicidal self-injury in Chinese middle school students?,These results suggest that Chinese middle school students with low HL and psychological symptoms are intending to exhibit NSSI. The intervention programs of mental health and behavior problems should enhance HL levels and attenuate the severity of psychological symptoms.

Do mechanisms of memory impairment in epilepsy depend on age at disease onset?,"This study reveals that memory deficits in people with focal epilepsy have differing antecedents depending on the timing of the disease onset. While neurobiological factors strongly underpin reduced autobiographic function in patients with early-onset epilepsy, psychological maladjustment gives rise to the impairments seen in patients with late-onset epilepsy. More broadly, these findings support the practice of subtyping patients according to distinct clinical characteristics to find individualized predictors of cognitive dysfunction."
Are cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of neurodegeneration decreased or normal in narcolepsy?,"Six CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration were decreased or normal in narcolepsy indicating that taupathy, synucleinopathy, and immunopathy are not prevalent in narcolepsy patients with a disease duration of 2-29 years. Lower CSF levels of β-amyloid, T-tau protein, and P-tau181 in narcolepsy may indicate that hypocretin deficiency and an abnormal sleep-wake pattern alter the turnover of these proteins in CNS."
Do strictly Lobar Cerebral Microbleeds Are Associated With Cognitive Impairment?,"Strictly lobar, but not deep or infratentorial, CMBs are associated with changes in cognitive function, especially in visuospatial executive functions. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy may be the underlying pathology associated with CMB-related cognitive impairment."
Do epoxy fatty acids mediate analgesia in murine diabetic neuropathy?,The EpFA are analgesic against chronic pain differing from opioids which have limited efficacy in chronic conditions.
Is hypomethylation of Interleukin-6 Promoter Associated with the Risk of Coronary Heart Disease?,"These findings suggest that DNA hypomethylation of IL-6 promoter is associated with the increased risk for CHD, especially for acute myocardial infarction. The two distinct CpGs in IL-6 may contribute differently to the development of CHD."
Do age-Based Differences in Task Switching Are Moderated by Executive Control Demands?,"Our findings suggest that task switching, coupled with infrequent and unexpected transitions from one task set to another, in the context of high motoric demands, is particularly difficult for older adults."
Does wNT5A signaling impair breast cancer cell migration and invasion via mechanisms independent of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition?,"WNT5A bi-directionally regulates EMT in mammary epithelial cells, thereby affecting their migration and invasion. However, the ability of WNT5A to inhibit breast cancer cell migration and invasion is an EMT-independent mechanism that, at least in part, can be explained by decreased CD44 expression."
Is antibiotic Treatment for First Episode of Acute Otitis Media Associated with Future Recurrences?,Oral antibiotic treatment of a first AOM episode occurring during infancy does not affect the number of AOM recurrences and AOM-related health care utilization later in life. This information can be used when weighing the pros and cons of various AOM treatment options.
Does task oriented training improve the balance outcome & reducing fall risk in diabetic population?,"Task oriented balance training is effective in improving the dynamic, anticipator and reactive balance. The task oriented training reduces the risk of falling through enhancing balance outcome."
Does the Offer of Advanced Imaging Techniques lead to Higher Acceptance Rates for Screening Colonoscopy - a Prospective Study?,Patients were highly interested in the offer of advanced imaging techniques. Knowledge about these techniques could relatively easy be provided using local media campaigns. The offer of advanced imaging techniques leads to higher acceptance rates for screening colonoscopies.
Do cerebral Biomarkers in Women With Preeclampsia Are Still Elevated 1 Year Postpartum?,Levels of NSE and S100B are still elevated 1 year postpartum in women who have had preeclampsia in contrast to women with previous normal pregnancies. We hypothesize that there might be a persistent cerebral involvement among women with preeclampsia even 1 year postpartum.
Do support for immigration reduction and physician distrust in the United States?,"Consistent with diversity and social capital research, this article finds that an immigration attitude predicts physician distrust. Physician distrust may not be linked just to physician-patient interactions, the structure of the health care system, or health policies, but could also be tied to declining social trust in general."
Does degree of obesity influence the relationship of PAI-1 with body fat distribution and metabolic variables in African women?,Fat distribution patterns and degree of obesity influenced the association of PAI-1
Is hyperlipidemia associated with lower risk of poststroke mortality independent of statin use : A population-based study?,"A diagnosis of HLD in ischemic stroke patients is associated with reduced short- and long-term mortality, irrespective of statin use. Statin therapy is associated with significant, additional long-term survival benefit."
Do transcranial Doppler in the evaluation of infants treated with retrograde ventriculosinus shunt?,"In our sample, transcranial Doppler could be used as a diagnostic and follow-up tool to evaluate hemodynamics and hydrodynamics in the preoperative and postoperative phases of RVSS. It was technically feasible in all patients, had close relation with other clinical and image parameters, and was sensitive to identify system malfunction."
Are intraparenchymal Hyperattenuations on Flat-Panel CT Directly After Mechanical Thrombectomy Restricted to the Initial Infarct Core on Diffusion-Weighted Imaging?,"The IPH primarily appeared within the initial ischemic core and secondarily within the penumbral tissue that progressed to infarction. The IPH represent the minimum final infarct volume, which may help in periinterventional decision making."

Further prospective studies are needed to assess the predictive ability of NLR and how it can be applied in the clinical setting.
Are plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids directly associated with cognition in overweight children but not in normal weight children?,These findings suggest that increasing the consumption of fish and other sources of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid may improve cognition among overweight children.
Does route-learning strategies in typical and atypical development ; eye tracking reveal atypical landmark selection in Williams syndrome?,"The current results demonstrate that attention to landmarks during route learning reflects the types of landmarks remembered in memory tasks, that individuals with WS can learn a route if given sufficient exposure, but that this is accomplished within the context of an impaired ability to select appropriate landmarks."
"Is reduced expression of CXCR4 , a novel renal cancer stem cell marker , associated with high-grade renal cell carcinoma?","Significantly higher expression levels of CXCR4 were found in pRCC and ccRCC samples. Increased CXCR4 expression was associated with more aggressive tumour behaviour in RCC patients, especially in pRCC and ccRCC subtypes due to their more metastatic behaviour. These findings suggest that CXCR4 can be considered as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic marker for targeted therapy of renal carcinoma."
Does elective cholecystectomy reduce morbidity of cholelithiasis in pediatric sickle cell disease?,"This represents the largest reported retrospective review of pediatric cholelithiasis and cholecystectomy in SCD to date. These data strongly suggest that elective cholecystectomy decreases morbidity associated with emergent cholecystectomy. The overall outcomes for symptomatic and elective patients are favorable. However, our study indicates the need for prospective studies to identify clinical indicators for those emergent patients."
Does robotic Resection of 3 cm and Larger Thymomas be Associated With Low Perioperative Morbidity and Mortality?,"In 3 cm or larger thymomas, robotic thymectomy is feasible based on the ability to achieve a complete resection with similar adjuvant radiation therapy rates. Perioperatively, robotic thymectomy is associated with lower morbidity; and shorter chest tube duration, intensive care unit stay, and hospital stay compared to open. However, oncologic outcomes are immature and require prolonged surveillance."
Does the APOE E4 Allele confer Increased Risk of Ischemic Stroke Among Greek Carriers?,"In contrast to some previous studies, these results support the role of the APOE E4 allele as an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke and ischemic coronary heart disease among Greek patients."
Does more Time be Taken to Administer Tissue Plasminogen Activator in Ischemic Stroke Patients with Earlier Presentations?,"There was a significant negative correlation between the LKW-to-code time and the code-to-tPA time that was independent of age, sex, NIHSS score, and race-ethnicity."
Do cell-cycle markers improve discrimination of EORTC and CUETO risk models in predicting recurrence and progression of non-muscle-invasive high-grade bladder cancer?,Markers were not significant predictors of recurrence nor progression in patients with high-grade NMIBC and their addition to prediction models is of little benefit.
Does vEGFR-2 reduce while combined VEGFR-2 and -3 signaling increases inflammation in apical periodontitis?,We demonstrate an anti-inflammatory effect of VEGFR-2 signaling in periapical lesions which seems to involve neutrophil regulation and is independent of angiogenesis. Combined signaling of VEGFR-2 and -3 has a pro-inflammatory effect. Lymph node lymphangiogenesis is promoted through activation of VEGFR-2 and/or VEGFR-3.
Are cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid Beta and Tau Concentrations Modulated by 16 Weeks of Moderate- to High-Intensity Physical Exercise in Patients with Alzheimer Disease?,"Our findings suggest that the possible effect of physical exercise on cognition in patients with AD is not due to modulation of Aβ, t-tau, p-tau and sAPP species."
Does a Dexamethasone-regulated Gene Signature be Prognostic for Poor Survival in Glioblastoma Patients?,Dexamethasone exposure induces a genetic program and CEBPB expression in GSCs that adversely affects key cellular functions and response to therapeutics. High risk scores associated with these genes have negative prognostic value in patients. Our findings further suggest camptothecin as a potential neutralizer of adverse dexamethasone-mediated effects.
Does aggressive Posterior Retinopathy of Prematurity be Associated with Multiple Infectious Episodes and Thrombocytopenia?,"Multiple infectious episodes and thrombocytopenia, particularly around the time of ROP diagnosis, were associated with APROP development."
Does the choice of internal fixator for fractures around the femoral trochanter depend on area classification?,A double rag screw should be considered for type 2-3. A long nail should be considered for type 3-4.
Do specific MRI findings help distinguish acute transverse myelitis of Neuromyelitis Optica from spinal cord infarction?,"Along with patient demographic characteristics, lesion features on MRI, including lesion location, extension to pial border and presence of 'bright spotty lesion' can help differentiate acute myelitis of NMO from SCI in the acute setting."
Do a latent class approach to understanding patterns of peer victimization in four low-resource settings?,The identified patterns of multiple forms of victimization highlight a limitation of common researcher-driven classifications and suggest avenues for future person-centered research to improve intervention development in LMIC settings.
Does dioscin attenuate gastric ischemia/reperfusion injury through the down-regulation of PKC/ERK1/2 signaling via PKCα and PKCβ2 inhibition?,"These data confirmed the protective effect of dioscin against gastric I/R injury, which should be developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of acute gastric mucosal lesions in the future."
Does `` Textural analysis of multiparametric MRI detect transition zone prostate cancer ''?,Textural features of the whole prostate TZ can discriminate significant prostatic cancer through reduced kurtosis of the ADC-histogram where significant tumour is included in TZ-ROI and reduced T1 entropy independent of tumour inclusion.
Is patient satisfaction with teledermatology related to perceived quality of life?,Patient acceptance and satisfaction with telemedicine services is complicated by patients' subjective health status. Telehealthcare providers need to recognize that patients with poor quality of life may want and benefit from face-to-face interaction with expert clinicians.
Is longterm anticoagulation preferable for patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome . result of a decision analysis?,"Although the applicability of this analysis to clinical decision-making is not entirely clear, patients with APS presenting with DVT appear to benefit from longterm warfarin (INR 3.0-4.0) that may be superior to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Short term warfarin therapy seems to be less beneficial and the use of ASA does not offer a clear additional benefit. Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide a better basis for recommendations for the treatment APS."
Is there no transmantle pressure gradient in communicating or noncommunicating hydrocephalus?,This study demonstrates no factual support for existence of a transmantle pressure gradient in nonacute communicating or noncommunicating hydrocephalus.
Are multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids associated with early severe lung disease in preterm neonates?,"ESLD, but not maternal risk factors, was associated with increased mortality in preterm infants after > or =3 courses ANCS."
Does low accuracy and low consistency of fourth-graders ' school breakfast and school lunch recall?,"The low accuracy and low consistency of children's recalls from this study raise concerns regarding the current uses of dietary recalls obtained from children. To improve the accuracy and consistency of children's dietary recalls, validation studies are needed to determine the best way(s) to interview children."
Does maximum Ki-67 staining in prostate cancer provide independent prognostic information after radical prostatectomy?,Estimates of Ki-67 growth fraction in areas of highest tumour grade may prove to be a useful prognostic biomarker after radical prostatectomy.
Does cerebellar blood volume in bipolar patients correlate with medication?,This evidence suggests that antipsychotic treatment may influence cerebellar blood volume. This effect will be important in considering imaging studies on medicated patients with bipolar disorder and may suggest novel pathways by which these medications affect their changes.
Does mismatch negativity predict psychotic experiences induced by NMDA receptor antagonist in healthy volunteers?,Smaller MMN indicates a NMDAR system that is more vulnerable to disruption by the NMDAR antagonist ketamine. MMN generation appears to index the functional state of NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission even in subjects who do not demonstrate any psychopathology.
Does beta-CIT-SPECT combined with UPDRS appear to distinguish different parkinsonian conditions?,The results suggest that the the combination of beta-CIT-SPECT and UPDRS motor scores has the potential to differentiate idiopathic Parkinson's disease from other parkinsonian conditions.
Is human neutrophil lipocalin a unique marker of neutrophil inflammation in ulcerative colitis and proctitis?,"We conclude that the increased release of HNL and MPO in colorectal perfusion fluids indicates neutrophil involvement in the local inflammatory process, and suggest that HNL may serve as a specific marker of intestinal neutrophil activation in UC. GM-CSF, and to some extent IL-8, may play a role in neutrophil accumulation and priming in this disease."
Does a polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene predispose to colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability?,"The TT genotype of MTHFR is associated with an increased risk of CRC in older populations, possibly due to age related disturbances in folate metabolism. The TT genotype appears to predispose to CRC that is MSI+. This may reflect the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation frequently associated with MSI+. The 844ins68 CBS polymorphism may protect against proximal tumours."
Does focal ictal beta discharge on scalp EEG predict excellent outcome of frontal lobe epilepsy surgery?,"Only about 25% of FLE surgical patients have a focal beta-frequency discharge at seizure onset on scalp EEG. However, its presence is highly predictive of excellent postsurgical seizure control in either lesional or non-lesional FLE surgical patients."
Are attention deficits characteristic of schoolchildren with newly diagnosed idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy?,"Children with newly diagnosed ""epilepsy only"" do not have persistent attention deficits. AED treatment has no detrimental effect on attention. Prior school and behavior difficulties and a maladaptive reaction to the onset of epilepsy rather than epilepsy variables are related to decreased attentional efficiency."
Do uterine and fetal cerebral Doppler predict the outcome of third-trimester small-for-gestational age fetuses with normal umbilical artery Doppler?,"SGA fetuses with normal umbilical artery Doppler waveforms and abnormal uterine arteries and fetal middle cerebral artery waveforms have an increased risk of developing distress and being delivered by emergency Cesarean section. Particularly when both uterine and fetal cerebral waveforms are altered at the same time, the risk is exceedingly high (86%) and delivery as soon as fetal maturity is achieved seems advisable. On the other hand, when both vessels have normal waveforms, the chances of fetal distress are small (4%) and expectant management is the most reasonable choice."
Do the acceptability of an emergency medical dispatch system to people who call 999 to request an ambulance?,"Introducing EMD increases the amount of first aid and general advice given to callers, and satisfaction with these aspects of the service, while maintaining satisfaction with response times. Overall satisfaction with the service increased. However, some changes may be needed to prevent a small amount of dissatisfaction directly associated with EMD."
Is severe dysosmia specifically associated with Alzheimer-like memory deficits in nondemented elderly retirees?,Impaired odor identification in individuals without overt dementia is associated with an AD-like memory impairment and an increased rate of cognitive decline. The comorbid association of these deficits is consistent with the known hierarchical spread of preclinical AD pathology and may be a specific indicator of future clinical AD dementia.
"Is regional anesthesia a good alternative to general anesthesia in pediatric surgery : Experience in 1,554 children?","Caudal anesthesia seems to be an inexpensive, simple, and effective technique not only as a supplement for postoperative analgesia, but also as a single method of anesthesia. and the authors recommend its use in a wider setting of clinical entities in infraumbilical surgical procedures of children."
Is prediction of tumour volume and pathological stage in radical prostatectomy specimens improved by taking more prostate needle-biopsy cores?,"While taking more prostate needle biopsy cores seems to improve the detection of prostate cancer, there appears to be no major improvement in prognostic information over that gained from traditional sextant biopsies. Furthermore, the results suggest that the percentage of positive cores is the best predictor of both pathological stage and tumour volume, from among the information readily available from prostate needle biopsy. Given the variability in the number of cores obtained for diagnosis in clinical practice, these results add credence to the use of the percentage of positive cores in the biopsy set, with known predictors such as PSA and Gleason score, into future models that attempt to predict tumour biology."
Does c-erbB-2 and c-Met expression relate to cholangiocarcinogenesis and progression of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma?,"These results indicate that increased c-Met expression participates in cholangiocarcinogenesis and in the early developmental stages of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, while increased c-erbB-2 expression contributes to the development of cholangiocarcinogenesis into an advanced stage associated with tumour metastasis."
Does massage therapy by mothers and trained professionals enhance weight gain in preterm infants?,"Mothers are able to achieve the same effect size as that of trained professionals, allowing cost-effective application of the treatment within the neonatal intensive care unit."
Does iron bind to the Apo-B protein of low-density lipoprotein?,"No binding was observed between iron, as a low molecular weight Fe(III) complex, and LDL. As a control albumin was able to bind iron, it seems evident that interaction of iron with LDL will involve other iron complexes."

These results indicate a negative regulatory role for TCPTP in cytokine signaling and provide insight into the molecular defect underlying the phenotype of TCPTP-deficient animals.
Is chromatin motion constrained by association with nuclear compartments in human cells?,This is the first report of distinct nuclear substructures constraining the movements of chromatin. These constraints reflect the physical attachment of chromatin to nuclear compartments or steric impairment caused by local ultrastructure. Our data suggest a role for the nucleolus and nuclear periphery in maintaining the three-dimensional organization of chromatin in the human nucleus.
Does native tissue second harmonic imaging improve endocardial and epicardial border definition in dobutamine stress echocardiography?,Native tissue SHI enhances LV image quality in all stress stages of DSE in unselected patients. This translates into beneficial effects on not only qualitative but also quantitative testing and diagnostic accuracy. SHI should be recommended as a standard tool in DSE and extends its applicability to difficult-to-image patients previously deemed unsuitable.
Is transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography as good as magnetic resonance imaging in measuring dynamic changes in left ventricular volume during the heart cycle in children?,Digitized 3DE performed in the outpatient clinic and MRI were both useful methods for studying the physiological volume changes in left ventricle in children. These methods may be used for further study of the systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle in various clinical conditions.
Is high transforming growth factor-beta and extracellular matrix mRNA response in renal allografts during early acute rejection associated with absence of chronic rejection?,"In summary, high mRNA levels for TGF-beta, collagen IV, and decorin, but not histopathologic changes, in biopsies taken during acute rejection episodes early after kidney transplantation are associated with absence of chronic rejection. We hypothesize that TGF-beta might have beneficial effects during acute rejection through its known antiinflammatory actions or as an inducer of tissue repair."
Does alcohol consumption alter insulin secretion and cardiac autonomic activity?,"The finding of no difference in insulin sensitivity between the two groups contrasts with, but does not entirely contradict, the results of previous epidemiological studies--perhaps suggesting that longer term changes such as liver enzyme induction may be important. The difference in insulin secretion questions the validity of previous studies of the influence of alcohol on insulin sensitivity, where insulin levels were used as a surrogate for insulin resistance."
Is interleukin-12 secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreased in normal pregnant subjects and increased in preeclamptic patients?,"Decreased IL-12 secretion by PBMC may cause Th2 dominance in normal pregnancy, while increased IL-12 secretion by activated monocytes may cause Th1 dominance in preeclampsia."
Is cD97-decay-accelerating factor interaction involved in leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells?,We found that high levels of human DAF expressed on ECs abrogates C-mediated cell damage but did not affect the in vitro adhesive properties or antigen-presenting cell function of genetically modified porcine ECs.
Is upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors associated with advanced neuroblastoma?,"VEGF-A(165) is one of the major angiogenesis regulators among the ligands' family of VEGF, whereas its receptors KDR, and most probably Flt-1, may contribute to a poor prognosis (angiogenic) phenotype, as indicated by their upregulated MRNA levels in stage III neuroblastoma. VEGF-A(165) mainly contributes to increased serum VEGF levels and may serve as a diagnostic tool in advanced-stage neuroblastoma."
Is the effect of APOE epsilon4 allele on cerebral glucose metabolism in AD a function of age at onset?,The current findings indicate that the impact of the APOE epsilon4 genotype on cerebral glucose metabolism of patients with AD may be a function of age at symptom onset.
Do antemortem MRI findings correlate with hippocampal neuropathology in typical aging and dementia?,"Hippocampal atrophy, while not specific for AD, was a fairly sensitive marker of the pathologic AD stage (particularly among subjects with isolated AD pathology [r = -0.63, p = 0.001]) and consequent cognitive status."
Are renal proximal tubular cell growth and differentiation differentially modulated by renotropic growth factors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors?,"In contrast to EGF and IGF-I, HGF stimulated both growth and differentiation of renal proximal tubular cells, demonstrating the amazing biological potency of this renotropic growth factor. Selective TKIs may be a promising approach to modulate diseases with abnormalities in protein kinase signalling pathways such as renal cell carcinoma."
Are antral nodularity and positive CagA serology distinct and relevant markers of severe gastric inflammation in children with Helicobacter pylori infection?,Antral nodularity and positive CagA serology are distinct and relevant markers of severe gastric inflammation in children with H. pylori infection. The lack of both findings in the same child reflects low-grade or no gastritis.
Does increased primary resistance to recommended antibiotics negatively affect Helicobacter pylori eradication?,Primary resistance to clarithromycin or amoxicillin may underscore a potentially serious problem for the eradication of H. pylori infection. Testing for bacterial resistance may become necessary to improve therapeutic efficacy.
Does estrogen status correlate with the calcium content of coronary atherosclerotic plaques in women?,"Estrogen status is associated with coronary calcium and plaque area independent of age and CHD risk factors. Estrogen may modulate the calcium content of atherosclerotic plaques, as well as plaque area and may slow the progression of atherosclerosis in women."
Does equal increase in respiratory system elastance reflect similar lung damage in experimental ventilator-induced lung injury?,"In the setting of VILI a 50% increase in Ers corresponds to an equal level of lung damage, irrespective of ventilatory setting and time of ventilation."
Are antenatal steroids associated with a reduction in the incidence of cerebral white matter lesions in very low birthweight infants?,These observations suggest that a complete course of antenatal steroids may have a protective effect against cerebral white matter lesions in very low birthweight infants.
Does human lymphocyte antigen DR7 protect against proliferative retinopathy with type II diabetes mellitus?,Our results suggest that the presence of HLA-DR7 protects against the development of proliferative disease in the diabetic Mexican population.
Does tissue tracking allow rapid and accurate visual evaluation of left ventricular function?,"Systolic mitral annular displacement determined by tissue tracking correlates closely with mitral annular displacement determined by M-mode and with left ventricular ejection fraction. Thus, tissue tracking allows rapid semiquantitative evaluation of global left ventricular function by assessment of systolic mitral annular displacement."
Does delta opioid activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade require transphosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases?,"Taken together, these data suggest that the transactivation of resident RTKs does not appear to be required for OR-mediated ERK phosphorylation and that the tyrosine-phosphorylated delta-OR, itself, is likely to act as its own signalling scaffold."
Does medial temporal lobe atrophy predict Alzheimer 's disease in patients with minor cognitive impairment?,"The ability to detect patients at high risk for Alzheimer type dementia among those with minor cognitive impairment increases when data on age and memory function are combined with measures of medial temporal lobe atrophy. Volumetry of the hippocampus is preferred, but qualitative rating of medial temporal lobe atrophy is a good alternative."
Is hypertension an independent predictor of delayed graft function and worse renal function only in kidneys with chronic pathological lesions?,"Our findings suggest that the quality of the transplanted organ and the occurrence of DGF are strictly related to each other and can influence graft function through apparently nonimmune mechanisms. In addition, long-standing donor hypertension is a strong independent variable affecting both DGF and graft function of suboptimal cadaveric kidneys, at least up to 1 year."
Is the APACHE II score unreliable to diagnose necrotizing pancreatitis on admission to hospital?,"The evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value for all APACHE II score points showed that there was not a ""golden"" cutoff to detect necrotizing pancreatitis. We conclude that the APACHE II score on admission to the hospital is unreliable to diagnose necrotizing pancreatitis."
"Are high viral loads , serum alanine aminotransferase and gender predictive factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma from viral compensated liver cirrhosis?",Individuals with high viral loads should be monitored for the development of HCC. Clinical efforts at eradicating or reducing the viral load may reduce the risk for HCC.
Is the food intake recording software system valid among fourth-grade children?,"FIRSSt is somewhat less accurate than a dietitian-conducted 24hDR. However, this lower-cost procedure provides a promising method for assessing diet among children. Observation of consumption at school lunch may be reactive and artificially increase agreement. Obtaining a hair sample as a bogus pipeline may be a valuable technique for enhancing the accuracy of dietary assessment among children."
Does reimbursement claim analysis of outcomes with carvedilol and metoprolol?,"Compared with metoprolol, the more comprehensive adrenergic blockade achieved with carvedilol may translate into greater clinical benefits in patients with HF. Despite higher pharmacy costs, lower total costs were observed in carvedilol-treated patients."

This molecular event is associated with advanced stages and circulating tumour cells. Our results could offer new approaches in the diagnosis and monitoring of colon cancer.
Does volume of lymphatic metastases independently influence prognosis in colorectal cancer?,"The number of nodes involved with metastatic tumor, rather the volume of metastatic involvement of the regional lymph nodes, predicts outcome. These results suggest that micrometastatic disease may have a similar prognosis as macrometastatic disease when the same number of lymph nodes are involved with metastatic tumor."
Do 6-MP metabolite profiles provide a biochemical explanation for 6-MP resistance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease?,Serial metabolite monitoring identifies a novel phenotype of IBD patients resistant to 6-MP/AZA therapy biochemically characterized by suboptimal 6-TGN and preferential 6-MMPR production upon dose escalation.
Is survival of fetal skin grafts prolonged on the human peripheral blood lymphocyte reconstituted-severe combined immunodeficient mouse/skin allograft model?,"Our results show that fetal skin differentiates and expresses increased amounts of MHC class I and class II antigens when transplanted to SCID mice. However, these levels are much lower than the levels found in neonatal skin. We demonstrate that the survival of human fetal skin allografts is markedly prolonged compared with that of neonatal skin grafts in the huPBMC-SCID mouse model. Our results support the hypothesis that low levels of MHC antigen expression lead to a delay in the rejection of fetal skin and further demonstrate the utility of the huPBMC-SCID mouse model to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the immune response to human fetal tissues."
Does the urge to smoke depend on the expectation of smoking?,It was shown that smoking cues elicit craving due mainly to a generated expectation of the occurrence of smoking and less due to salience or long history of associative learning. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.
Is feeding dysfunction associated with poor growth and health status in children with cerebral palsy?,"For children with moderate to severe cerebral palsy, feeding dysfunction is a common problem associated with poor health and nutritional status. Even children with only mild feeding dysfunction, requiring chopped or mashed foods, may be at risk for poor nutritional status. Parental report of feeding dysfunction with a structured questionnaire may be useful in screening children for nutritional risk."

Does expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor correlate with perineural invasion of bile duct carcinoma?,The results suggest that GDNF expression in tumor cells and GFRalpha1 and RET expression in peripheral nerve tissues may play a role in perineural invasion in patients with bile duct carcinoma through chemoattraction among these molecules.
Is there poor agreement between manual auscultatory and automated oscillometric methods for the measurement of blood pressure in normotensive pregnant women?,"Although an underestimation of only 10 mmHg was shown, this can be of great importance in delaying a correct diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. The assessment of agreement of the Dinamap 1846 sx/p device in hypertensive pregnant patients should also be determined. A prospective study could be useful to determine the effectiveness of an automated device in detecting hypertensive disease in pregnancy."
Do bone marrow-derived regenerated cardiomyocytes ( CMG Cells ) express functional adrenergic and muscarinic receptors?,"These findings indicate that CMG cells expressed alpha(1A), alpha(1B), and alpha(1D) receptors before differentiation and expressed beta(1), beta(2), M(1), and M(2) receptors after they obtained the cardiomyocyte phenotype. These receptors had functional signal transduction pathways and could modulate cell function."
Do cognitive and motor impairments predict functional declines in patients with vascular dementia?,These results suggest that attentional/executive and motor impairments may underlie specific aspects of functional disability among patients with VaD.
Do [ Therapy of radiation resistant malignant uveal melanoma with endoresection by pars plana vitrectomy in two patients ]?,"Malignant choroidal melanomas can be safely removed by pars plana vitrectomy with stable intraocular pressure. Previous radiation therapy alters the tumor, inducing fibrous tissue growth and necrosis of tumor cells. These tissue types are not prone to bleed when they are resected by the vitrectomy cutter. Long time studies have to elucidate the difference in survival rates between patients undergoing enucleation of the eye and patients who chose endoresection of the melanoma by pars plana vitrectomy."
Do pharmacokinetics of morphine and its glucuronidated metabolites in burn injuries?,"To our knowledge, this is the first published report describing morphine, M3G, and M6G disposition in patients with major thermal burn injury. The Cls of morphine is similar to that observed in other patient populations and healthy subjects, suggesting that the presence of major burn injuries or a continuous morphine infusion over a three-week period may not contribute significantly to the variability among individuals. In these cases, the renal clearance of morphine and its glucuronides was within the range of values reported for other populations of patients and healthy subjects. Recovery of morphine and its glucuronides in urine was also similar to that in healthy individuals."
Is [ Familial febrile convulsions supposed to link to human chromosome 19p13.3 ]?,"FC is linked with chromosome region 19p13.3, but not with chromosome 8q."
Is partial elective pancreatectomy curative in focal form of permanent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia in infancy : A report of 45 cases from 1983 to 2000?,"PHHI is not a homogeneous disease. In one third of cases, only a small amount of endocrine pancreas is abnormal, and conservative surgery is mandatory. The pre- and perioperative conditions to point out the focal pancreatic lesion are described."
"Are mMP-2 and TIMP-1 derived from , not in response to , pancreatic cancer?","In a murine model for human pancreatic cancer, nearly all TIMP-1 and MMP-2 expression is tumor-derived (i.e., human). Pharmacologic and gene therapy aimed at disturbing the MMP/TIMP balance in pancreatic cancer should be targeted toward tumor-specific mechanisms and warrants continued investigation."
Do neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease differ in Chinese and American patients?,"We found support for our hypothesis, in that Chinese subjects presented during a more severe stage of dementia than American subjects, but the delay in seeking care could not be correlated with significant differences in neuropsychiatric profiles of the demented subjects. Other barriers to dementia care warrant investigation."
Is reduced arterial distensibility a predictor of cardiovascular disease in patients after renal transplantation?,The distensibility of the common carotid artery is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease in renal transplant recipients.
Does software compensation improve the analysis of heterogeneous tumor samples stained for multiparameter DNA flow cytometry?,"We conclude that software compensation is a robust and reliable post-acquisition method for the correction of RPE/PI spectral cross-talk, permitting better identification of weakly expressed proteins in heterogeneous clinical tumor samples stained for multiple cellular antigens and DNA using PI."
"Are carotid plaques , but not common carotid intima-media thickness , independently associated with aortic stiffness?",This study shows that there is a differential association of PWV with CCA-IMT and carotid plaques. The nature of the independent positive association between atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness should be thoroughly investigated.
Does transcutaneous electrical stimulation of an auricular acupuncture point decrease anesthetic requirement?,This double-blinded trial with an objective outcome demonstrates that electrical stimulation of the lateralization control point significantly reduces anesthetic requirement.
Does lumbar sagittal balance influence the clinical outcome after decompression and posterolateral spinal fusion for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis?,Both preoperative L1 axis S1 distance and lordosis at follow-up assessment affected surgical outcome. Reduction of slippage may improve clinical outcomes of posterolateral fusion for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis with an L1 axis S1 distance more than 35 mm.
Is butyrylcholinesterase K variant on chromosome 3 q associated with Type II diabetes in white Caucasian subjects?,"The association of the BcHE gene (3q26) with Type II diabetes could be related to an identified susceptibility locus on chromosome 3q27 but appears to be independent of islet function. The absence of diabetes-specific associations with alpha2M, ApoE or ApoE promoter variants suggest that these are not important in the onset of hyperglycaemia."
Are stromelysin-1 ( matrix metalloproteinase-3 ) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 overexpressed in the wall of abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"Both AAA and AOD walls express similar levels of a wide range of MMPs, including cell membrane-bound MT-MMPs. Stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and TIMP-3 were, however, over expressed in the AAA samples and may be involved aneurysm pathogenesis. Stromelysin-1 could provide a target for pharmacological inhibition."
Does age transformation of combined hippocampus and amygdala volume improve diagnostic accuracy in Alzheimer 's disease?,Age transformation may provide an easily applicable method to increase the clinical diagnostic accuracy of hippocampal measurements by considering the effect of aging on hippocampus volume.
Does subthreshold low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation selectively decrease facilitation in the motor cortex?,Subthreshold low frequency rTMS depresses cortical excitability beyond the duration of the train. This effect seems primarily due to cortical dysfacilitation. These results have implications on the therapeutic use of rTMS.
Are auditory event-related potentials during target detection abnormal in mild cognitive impairment?,"Brain potentials in MCI subjects during target detection have certain features similar to healthy aging (RP, N100, P200, N200), and other features similar to Alzheimer's disease (delayed P300 latency, slower reaction time). P50 differences in MCI may reflect pathophysiological changes in the modulation of auditory cortex by association cortical regions having neuropathological changes in early Alzheimer's disease."
Is time-efficient T2 relaxometry of the entire hippocampus feasible in temporal lobe epilepsy?,"Hippocampal dual-echo TSE-relaxometry can be regarded a reliable technique to detect and quantify HS. With a scan time of 3.31 minutes and immediate off-line analysis lasting a few minutes only, TSE-T2 relaxometry is easy to integrate in the routine diagnostic assessment of hippocampal morphology in large numbers of patients."
Does treatment of Crohn 's disease with recombinant human interleukin 10 induce the proinflammatory cytokine interferon gamma?,High doses of IL-10 upregulate the production of IFN-gamma and neopterin. This phenomenon may be responsible for the lack of efficacy of high doses of IL-10 in the treatment of CACD and MCD.
Does primary lymphatic metastatic spread in testicular cancer occur ventral to the lumbar vessels?,"On the basis of these data, we believe that primary lymphatic metastatic spread in testicular cancer always occurs ventral to the lumbar vessels. Therefore, the removal of lymphatic tissue behind the lumbar vessels for diagnostic procedures is not necessary."
Does the effect of confirmation call on appointment-keeping behavior of patients in a children 's hospital dental clinic?,Confirmation calls reduced the percentage of broken appointments in a pediatric dental clinic. There was no difference between calls placed one or two working days prior to the appointment. The greatest reduction in broken appointments was shown in the private insurance group.
Is a more advanced clinical stage positively correlated with an increased prostate cancer detection rate?,"We found a modified version of the clinical stage (ie, extracapsular, clinical T3 or T4 cancer versus intracapsular) to be significantly better in predicting the presence of prostate cancer at a given prostate-specific antigen level than a simple ""yes or no abnormality found on DRE and/or TRUS"" qualification. A suspicion of extracapsular disease raised on the basis of the DRE findings should be valued differently than a similar suspicion raised on the basis of the TRUS findings. Apparently, the extracapsular lesions seen by TRUS are primarily nonmalignant."
Do manipulation of prenatal hormones and dietary phytoestrogens during adulthood alter the sexually dimorphic expression of visual spatial memory?,"These results suggest that prenatal hormonal manipulations significantly sex-reverse the normal sexually dimorphic expression of VSM. Specifically, VSM was enhanced in females treated with testosterone and inhibited in males treated with flutamide. Finally, dietary soy phytoestrogens set a bias on learning and memory in these hormonally manipulated animals in a predictable manner and these data confirm and extend the findings in our companion paper."
Is visual spatial memory enhanced in female rats ( but inhibited in males ) by dietary soy phytoestrogens?,"Results suggest that dietary phytoestrogens significantly sex-reversed the normal sexually dimorphic expression of VSM. Specifically, in tasks requiring the use of reference, but not working, memory, VSM was enhanced in females fed the Phyto-600 diet, whereas, in males VSM was inhibited by the same diet. These findings suggest that dietary soy derived phytoestrogens can influence learning and memory and alter the expression of proteins involved in neural protection and inflammation in rats."
Are changes in physical activity associated with changes in metabolic cardiovascular risk factors?,"Increased leisure time physical activity between the ages of 50 and 70 years, in the absence of active intervention, is associated with improved glucose, insulin and lipid metabolism in men. The concentrations of insulin, proinsulin and split proinsulin could mediate much of the association between a sedentary lifestyle and increased risk of cardiovascular mortality."
Does meningococcal bacterial DNA load at presentation correlate with disease severity?,Patients with MCD have higher bacterial loads than previously determined with quantitative culture methods. Admission bacterial load is significantly higher in patients with severe disease (GMSPS > or =8) and maximum load is highest in those who die. Bacterial load is independent of the duration of clinical symptoms or the decline in DNA load.
Does hypnosis increase heat detection and heat pain thresholds in healthy volunteers?,"These results indicate that hypnosis may partly impair the detection of A delta and C fibers stimulation, potentially explaining its analgesic effect."
Do high coronary artery calcium scores pose an extremely elevated risk for hard events?,"A high CS (> or = 1,000) on a screening EBT in an asymptomatic person portends a very high risk of an HCE in the short term. This risk appears to be greater than the risk associated with a severe perfusion abnormality on MPI."
Does long term treatment with sodium hyaluronate-containing artificial tears reduce ocular surface damage in patients with dry eye?,Sodium hyaluronate may effectively improve ocular surface damage associated with dry eye syndrome.
Is cD64 surface expression on neutrophils transiently upregulated in patients with septic shock?,Decreased neutrophil CD64 expression in an acutely ill population with septic shock may reflect the development of a non-responsive state as well as the early downregulation of neutrophil activation prior to the resolution of an ongoing infection.
Is biopsy specimen microvessel density a useful prognostic marker in patients with T ( 2-4 ) M ( 0 ) esophageal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy?,These results indicate that MVD using pretreatment biopsy specimens is a potentially useful prognostic marker for CRT in patients with T(2-4)M(0) esophageal cancer who are treated with CRT.
Does delayed motherhood increase the probability of sons to be infertile?,Delayed motherhood may enhance the probability of sons to be infertile. The probability of a man being infertile would be greater if he comes from a small family than if he comes from a large family.
"Are macrophages associated with lipid-rich carotid artery plaques , echolucency on B-mode imaging , and elevated plasma lipid levels?","Increased macrophage density in carotid atherosclerotic plaques was associated with lipid content, plaque echolucency, and increased plasma and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Furthermore, use of aspirin was associated with reduced macrophage density in carotid artery plaques."
Does mammographic appearance of nonpalpable breast cancer reflect pathologic characteristics?,"Malignancies presenting as calcifications on mammography are most commonly DCIS. When invasive malignancies presented as calcifications, the calcifications were associated with accompanying high-grade DCIS, and the invasive cancers were often Her2/Neu positive. Mammographic masses with calcifications were associated with lymphatic invasion. Excisional biopsy margins were most commonly positive with architectural distortions. The mammographic appearance of nonpalpable malignancies is related to pathologic characteristics with prognostic value, which varies with patient age and influences clinical management."
Does obesity portend a bad outcome for kidney transplant recipients?,Obese transplant recipients have similar outcomes to nonobese patients.
Do electrocardiographic electrodes provide the same results as expensive special sensors in the routine monitoring of anesthetic depth?,The Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor adequately monitors depth of anesthesia. The routine use of this monitor has been hampered by the benefit-cost equation because only special expensive electrodes can be used. We examined the agreement of BIS values obtained by original sensor electrodes and commercial electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes. These ECG electrodes can replace more expensive BIS sensors.
Is adrenocortical activity in healthy children associated with fat mass?,"Although direct effects of UFF and UFE on body composition were not shown, our findings strongly suggest that a higher adrenocortical activity is one endocrine-metabolic feature of healthy children with higher body fat. Whether urinary GC is a long-term predictor of fat gain during childhood should be analyzed in future studies."
Is arachidonic acid status during pregnancy associated with polychlorinated biphenyl exposure?,"Increased PCB exposure was associated with a modest decrease in serum AA concentrations, which is in accordance with the experimental evidence of desaturase inhibition by PCBs. Such interference with LCP utilization could attenuate the beneficial effects of the essential lipids contained in seafood. Because AA is of key importance for growth and development, these results suggest that this possible mechanism for PCB toxicity deserves to be explored."
Does a modified cryopreservation method increase the survival of human biopsied cleavage stage embryos?,Survival of human biopsied cleavage stage embryos can be restored to a level similar to that of non-biopsied controls by modification of the cryopreservation procedure. Embryos which have been cryopreserved using the modified method can implant following replacement in utero.
Are specialized medical search-engines no better than general search-engines in sourcing consumer information about androgen deficiency?,"Despite the poor quality of online information relating to ADAM, it is evident that medical search-engines are no better than general search-engines in sourcing consumer information relevant to ADAM."
Does late gestational intrauterine myelomeningocele repair improve lower extremity function?,"Although the current timing of intrauterine myelomeningocele repair has been found to lessen the degree of herniation of the rhombencephalon and reduce the incidence of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus, it does not statistically improve LEF. Parents should be advised of these findings prior to surgical intervention so as to focus their expectations."
Is brain dopamine associated with eating behaviors in humans?,These results provide evidence that DA in the dorsal striatum is involved with the restraint and emotionality components regulating eating behavior and that these two dimensions reflect different neurobiologic processes.
Does transthoracic echocardiography improve prediction of outcome over APACHE II in medical-surgical intensive care?,"Statistical models utilizing clinical variables are predictive of mortality in MSICU. Models that include diagnostic transthoracic echocardiography variables do not provide incremental value to predict ICU mortality. These findings may have implications for non-invasive hemodynamic assessment of critically ill patients, and raise the hypothesis that echocardiography-guided interventions may not alter outcome in ICU."
Is diastolic blood pressure the first to rise in association with early subclinical obstructive sleep apnea : lessons from periodic examination screening?,Diastolic blood pressure is higher early in the course of OSAS. Long term follow-up may determine effects of prevention and early intervention in OSAS and associated hypertension.
Do osteo/chondrocytic transcription factors and their target genes exhibit distinct patterns of expression in human arterial calcification?,"These observations suggest a sequence of molecular events in vascular calcification beginning with the loss of expression by VSMCs, of constitutive inhibitory proteins, and ending with expression by VSMCs and macrophages of chondrocytic, osteoblastic, and osteoclastic-associated proteins that orchestrate the calcification process."
Does meta-analysis of EEG test performance show wide variation among studies?,"This analysis suggests that there is wide interreader variation in sensitivity and specificity of EEG interpretations, and that this variation influences the ability of EEG to discriminate between those who will and will not have seizure recurrences. In clinical practice, interpreting the degree to which a positive EEG result predicts increased seizure risk in an individual patient is difficult. Interpreting EEG with higher specificity yields more accurate predictions."
Is gABA ( B ) receptor 1 polymorphism ( G1465A ) associated with temporal lobe epilepsy?,"The results of this study indicate that the GABA(B[1]) polymorphism (G1465A) confers a highly increased susceptibility to TLE. Moreover, it seems to influence the severity of this common epileptic disorder."
Do evaluation of the accuracy of three techniques used for multiple implant abutment impressions?,"Within the limitations of this study, improved accuracy of the master cast was achieved when the impression technique involved square impression copings joined together with autopolymerizing acrylic resin or square impression copings that had been airborne particle-abraded and adhesive-coated."
Is the perceived urgency of auditory warning alarms used in the hospital operating room inappropriate?,"The alarms currently in use do not convey the intended sense of urgency to naïve listeners, and this holds even for two sets of alarms designed specifically by manufacturers to convey different levels of urgency."
Does dexamethasone prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting more effectively in women with motion sickness?,"Prophylactic administration of dexamethasone is effective in reducing PONV in patients with and without a history of motion sickness. The results of this study were more favourable in patients with a history of motion sickness, demonstrating a higher effectiveness of dexamethasone for preventing PONV in this subgroup of patients."
Does xenon attenuate cardiopulmonary bypass-induced neurologic and neurocognitive dysfunction in the rat?,"These data indicate that CPB-induced neurologic and neurocognitive dysfunction can be attenuated by the administration of xenon, potentially related to its neuroprotective effect via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism."
Are clinicopathological features of nine cases of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension : current definitions and criteria inadequate?,The hepatic morphology in this group of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension patients was an abnormal remodelling of the liver associated with the frequent development of irregular hyperplastic nodules and frequent obstructions of the pre- and intrahepatic vascular lumens. It was very difficult to apply the nomenclature proposed by international experts.
"Is variation in the DCP1 gene , encoding the angiotensin converting enzyme ACE , associated with increased susceptibility to Alzheimer 's disease?","Further research is needed to elucidate any role that the DCP1 polymorphism may play in relation to Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies may be false positive, or inconsistency in replication may be due to heterogeneity."
Do residual flow signals predict complete recanalization in stroke patients treated with TPA?,Patients with detectable residual flow signals before IV TPA bolus are twice as likely to have early complete recanalization. Those with no detectable residual flow signals have less than 20% chance for complete early recanalization with intravenous TPA and may be candidates for intra-arterial therapies.
Do cognitive-behavioral interventions improve quality of life in women with AIDS?,Results suggest that group-based CBSM+ and individual psychoeducational interventions are effective at improving certain aspects of QOL and that group-based CBSM+ may be particularly effective at increasing QOL related to mental health in this population of women with AIDS.
Is development of rheumatoid arthritis associated with two polymorphisms in the Crohn 's disease gene CARD15?,"Within defined statistical parameters, we excluded a role for the CARD15 1007fs and R702W variants in RA susceptibility. These data do not preclude a role for other polymorphisms in the CARD15 gene in RA susceptibility. Results from other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases will reveal whether the CARD15 gene is in fact a common autoimmune susceptibility locus."
Does intima-media thickness of carotid artery predict cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients?,These results indicate that increased CA-IMT is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in the hemodialysis population.
Is intracytoplasmic sperm injection with testicular spermatozoa less successful in men with nonobstructive azoospermia than in men with obstructive azoospermia?,"A statistically significant lower rate of fertilization and pregnancy results from ICSI with testicular sperm from men with nonobstructive azoospermia, compared with men with obstructive azoospermia."
Do validation of the FibroTest biochemical markers score in assessing liver fibrosis in hepatitis C patients?,The FibroTest score could not accurately predict the presence or absence of significant liver fibrosis.
Is extrapolation of reciprocal creatinine plot reliable in predicting the onset of dialysis in patients with progressive renal insufficiency?,The onset of dialysis cannot be predicted by extrapolation of the reciprocal creatinine plot because of individual variation in the renal function that require dialysis. Dialysis would be almost imminent in some patients by the time serum creatinine reaches a level that allows accurate construction and extrapolation of a plot.
Are serum estradiol levels after 4 days of ovarian hyperstimulation in oocyte donors predictive of embryo quality and clinical outcomes?,"After 4 days of gonadotropin stimulation, an E(2) level of >350 pg/ml is most predictive of higher embryo grade and pregnancy outcome in oocyte donation."
Are epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 concentrations elevated in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis?,"Levels of ENA-78 are elevated in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. Ectopic glandular cells, ectopic stromal cells, and peritoneal macrophages express this inflammatory chemokine. Epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis."
Do interleukin-13 and tumor necrosis factor-beta differentially regulate the production of cytokines by cultured human endometrial stromal cells?,These results suggest that IL-13 and TNF-beta secreted in the cyclic endometrial tissue and in the decidua may differentially regulate the production of IL-6 family cytokines and chemokines by ESC. The controlled expression of these cytokines in the endometrium may contribute to the modulation of the immune reaction during the menstrual cycle and in early pregnancy by the regulation of leukocyte trafficking and functions.
Is cyclooxygenase-2 expression associated with well-differentiated and intestinal-type pathways in gastric carcinogenesis?,"These results suggest that COX-2 may play an important role in the evolution of gastric carcinogenesis and be associated with well-differentiated and intestinal type pathways in gastric carcinogenesis. However, COX-2 expression seems to be less useful for establishing prognosis for gastric cancer."
Does bronchodilator premedication decrease respiratory adverse events in pediatric general anesthesia?,"Adverse events were neither predicted nor prevented. In afebrile outpatient ASA I and II children with no lung disease or findings, having non-cavitary, non-airway surgery for under three hours, there was no association between either recent URI or active URI and desaturation, wheeze, cough, stridor, or laryngospasm causing desaturation (all P > 0.05). In this highly selected population of afebrile patients, the results suggest that anesthesiologists may proceed with surgery using specific criteria in the presence of a URI."
Does eMS provider level impact use of air medical transport?,The change in EMS provider level from EMT-I to paramedic in this semirural area had no impact on the number of air medical transports. The acuity of patients flown after the change in EMS provider level remained similar based on common hemodynamic and injury severity markers.
Does liberal use of computed tomography scanning improve diagnostic accuracy in appendicitis?,"The use of preoperative abdominal CT scanning has not improved the accuracy of the diagnosis of appendicitis at our institution. It has resulted in a significant increase in Emergency Department preoperative length of stay and the finding of a normal appendix at surgery. As nonsurgeons ordered the majority of preoperative CT scans, earlier input by surgeons might increase the rate of accurate clinical diagnosis and decrease the number of CT scans ordered."
Does mild to moderate chronic airways disease carry an excess risk of cognitive dysfunction?,Non-hypoxemic COPD did not increase the risk of subclinical cognitive dysfunction in an older population.
Does depression in intractable partial epilepsy vary by laterality of focus and surgery?,"Patients undergoing right hemispheric epilepsy surgery, especially those with high presurgical depression-related morbidity, may be particularly susceptible to clinical depression. Our findings support other studies that show an interhemispheric modulation of depressive traits and symptoms."
Is docetaxel and carboplatin an active regimen in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer : a phase II study in Caucasian and Asian patients?,This regimen is active in advanced NSCLC. The potential impact of ethnicity on efficacy and toxicity of treatment requires further investigation.
Does off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting decrease the incidence of atrial fibrillation?,Avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass did not aid the reduction of atrial fibrillation at our institution.
Do cSF Abeta 42 levels correlate with amyloid-neuropathology in a population-based autopsy study?,"The current study suggests that lower Abeta 42 levels reflect neuropathologic processes implicated in amyloid-related pathologies, such as NP and CAA."
Do dimensions of religiosity and their relationship to lifetime psychiatric and substance use disorders?,"Religiosity is a complex, multidimensional construct with substantial associations with lifetime psychopathology. Some dimensions of religiosity are related to reduced risk specifically for internalizing disorders, and others to reduced risk specifically for externalizing disorders, while still others are less specific in their associations. These results do not address the nature of the causal link between religiosity and risk for illness."
Does stereotactic radiosurgery provide equivalent tumor control to Simpson Grade 1 resection for patients with small- to medium-size meningiomas?,"The PFS rate after radiosurgery was equivalent to that after resection of a Simpson Grade 1 tumor and was superior to Grade 2 and 3-4 resections in our study. If long-term follow-up confirms the high tumor control rate and low morbidity of radiosurgery, this technique will likely become the preferred treatment for most patients with small- to moderate-size meningiomas without symptomatic mass effect."
Is opioid-induced respiratory depression associated with increased tidal volume variability?,"Opioids cause a more complicated disturbance of the control of respiration than a mere resetting to higher PCO2. Furthermore, Qeff20V(T) appears to predict the severity of opioid-induced respiratory depression."
Do executive dysfunction and apathy predict functional impairment in Alzheimer disease?,These findings suggest that specific cognitive and behavioral symptoms are associated with functional impairment in patients with AD.
Does sustainability in changing clinical practice promote evidence-based nursing care?,"Sustainability in QI work was significantly related to supportive leadership, facilitative human resources, increased activity in seeking new research and enhanced implementation of research findings in clinical practice. It appears that these factors constitute a necessary prerequisite for professional development and the establishment of evidence-based practice."
Do usefulness of bone window CT images parallel to the transnasal surgical route for pituitary disorders?,"Bone window CT images sliced parallel to the transnasal surgical route provide direct visualization of the nasal anatomy for the transnasal approach. This method is helpful in determining how far to remove the sellar floor laterally, especially in cases requiring repeat surgery."
Does the use of computed tomography for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children influence the overall rate of negative appendectomy or perforation?,The use of CT for the diagnosis of appendicitis in children does not change the negative appendectomy rate. Results of studies performed in adults may not be extrapolated to the evaluation of children with suspected acute appendicitis.
Does use of an electronic medical record improve the quality of urban pediatric primary care?,"Use of the EMR in this study was associated with improved quality of care. This experience suggests that EMRs can be successfully used in busy urban pediatric primary care centers and, as recommended by the Institute of Medicine, must play a central role in the redesign of the US health care system."
Is work stress and low sense of coherence associated with type 2 diabetes in middle-aged Swedish women?,This study provided new evidence that stress factors such as low decision latitude at work and low SOC were associated with type 2 diabetes in middle-aged Swedish women.
Is poor response to ovulation induction a stronger predictor of early menopause than elevated basal FSH : a life table analysis?,Both poor response to ovarian stimulation and raised basal FSH are markers of reduced ovarian reserve and predict an increased risk of early menopause.
Is expression of PPAR-gamma correlated with the clinical course of neuroblastoma?,PPAR-gamma may have played a role in the reduction of VMA and possibly in the regression of early-onset neuroblastoma.
Is nuclear factor-kappaB activity down-regulated in nasal polyps from aspirin-sensitive asthmatics?,This study shows that the low expression of COX-2 mRNA in nasal polyps from aspirin-sensitive patients is associated with a down-regulation of NF-kappaB activity.
Do urodynamic results of sacral neuromodulation correlate with subjective improvement in patients with an overactive bladder?,"The objective and subjective results show a decrease in bladder overactivity during SNS. During SNS bladder instabilities are still present, which is in accordance with the published literature. The reduction of the DAI during SNS as compared to before SNS correlates significantly to the clinical effect of SNS."
Is preoperative enterocolitis associated with poorer long-term bowel function after Soave-Boley endorectal pull-through for Hirschsprung 's disease?,Preoperative HAEC was the most important factor in relation to functional outcome after ERPT for HD. The reason remains unclear.
Is the WFS1 ( Wolfram syndrome 1 ) a major susceptibility gene for the development of psychiatric disorders?,Our results suggest that WFS1 is not a major susceptibility gene for the development of psychiatric disorders in our population.
Does number of metastatic sites rather than location dictate overall survival of patients with node-negative metastatic renal cell carcinoma?,Patients with mRCC to only one organ site fared significantly better than patients who had evidence of disease in multiple organs. Survival in patients with disease limited to the lung was similar to that of patients whose disease was limited to bone.
Does cardiac contractility modulation with nonexcitatory electric signals improve left ventricular function in dogs with chronic heart failure?,"In dogs with HF, CCM signal delivery for 6 hours elicited marked improvement in LV function. This novel approach may represent a useful adjunctive therapy for the treatment of patients with HF."
Are elevated levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome decreased by nasal continuous positive airway pressure?,"Levels of CRP and IL-6 and spontaneous production of IL-6 by monocytes are elevated in patients with OSAS but are decreased by nCPAP. Therefore, OSAS is associated with increased risks for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and nCPAP may be useful for decreasing these risks."
Does epinephrine unmask latent mutation carriers with LQT1 form of congenital long-QT syndrome?,"Epinephrine challenge is a powerful test to establish electrocardiographic diagnosis in silent LQT1 mutation carriers, thus allowing implementation of prophylactic measures aimed at reducing sudden cardiac death."
Does the diagnostic significance of video-EEG monitoring findings on pseudoseizure patients differ between neurologists and psychiatrists?,Resolving the differences between neurologists and psychiatrists would be helpful in caring for psychogenic pseudoseizure patients. These results support the need to encourage psychiatrists to have an integral involvement in epilepsy centers and to improve the understanding of psychogenic pseudoseizures in both disciplines.
Does inclusion of turnover time influence identification of surgical services that over- and underutilize allocated block time?,Turnover time is difficult to determine from existing operating room information systems. This study determined the use of block time with and without turnover time for each surgical service in a large academic hospital. Turnover time did not change identification of surgical services that over- (one service) or underused (three services) allocated block time.
Do surgical infants on total parenteral nutrition have impaired cytokine responses to microbial challenge?,The inflammatory response to bacterial challenge is impaired in infants on TPN compared with enterally fed infants or adults. The pattern of this response may be dependent on the nature of the microbial challenge. Our results indicate that the susceptibility of TPN-fed surgical infants to bacterial infections may in part be caused by impaired cytokine responses after bacterial invasion.
Does physiological correlate with endurance running performance in trained adolescents?,The physiological variables that were most strongly correlated with middle-distance running performance were v2.5 and the vV0(2peak). To a lesser extent peak V02 may also play a role although it is understood that its contribution may be accounted by vV0(2 peak).
Is psoriasin ( S100A7 ) expression altered during skin tumorigenesis?,These results suggest that altered psoriasin expression occurs in abnormal epidermis and that downregulation may be related to the onset of invasion in squamous cell carcinoma in skin.
Does brief motivational feedback improve post-incarceration treatment contact among veterans with substance use disorders?,Brief motivational feedback shows promise as a way to link incarcerated individuals to SUD treatment services.
Is the methylentetrahydrofolate reductase C677T point mutation a risk factor for vascular access thrombosis in hemodialysis patients?,"Although AVF obstruction is affected by numerous factors, there was a strong relationship between MTHFR C677T mutation and AVF obstruction. These findings suggest that the MTHFR C677T point mutation could serve as an important indicator in identifying susceptibility to AVF obstruction."
Does cNV subtype in first eyes predict severity of ARM in fellow eyes?,The type and extent of CNV in the first affected eye has a distinct relation to ARM severity in the fellow eye. Fellow eyes of subjects with minimally classic or occult CNV in the first affected eye show widespread ARM changes suggestive of retinal pigment epithelial dysfunction. These findings suggest that classic CNV may be focal disease while occult CNV is essentially a more widespread retinal pigment epithelial disorder.
Is microfilament disruption required for enucleation and nuclear transfer in germinal vesicle but not metaphase II human oocytes?,Microfilament disruption before enucleation is required for germinal vesicle oocytes but not for metaphase II oocytes.
Does warm ischemia time correlate with recipient graft function in laparoscopic donor nephrectomy?,"Warm ischemia time does not correlate with recipient graft function in LDN within the range of times studied. Shorter warm ischemia time associated with open donor nephrectomy and hand-assisted LDN does not necessarily offer a measurable advantage in recipient graft function. During extraction of the kidney, expediency to minimize warm ischemia time should not supersede controlled and safe maneuvers in renal vessel division and extraction of the kidney."
Does deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus enhance emotional processing in Parkinson disease?,"Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus selectively enhanced affective processing and subjective well-being and seemed to be antidepressive. Levodopa and deep brain stimulation had similar effects on emotion. This finding may provide new clues about the neurobiologic bases of emotion and mood disorders, and it illustrates the important role of the basal ganglia and the dopaminergic system in emotional processing in addition to the well-known motor and cognitive functions."
"Is significant non-alcoholic fatty liver disease found in non-diabetic , pre-obese Chinese in Singapore?",Significant histological changes of NASH with hepatic fibrosis were found in Singaporean Chinese non-diabetic patients with BMI of less than 30 kg per square metres.
Is parental tobacco use associated with increased risk of child malnutrition in Bangladesh?,In Bangladesh parental tobacco use may exacerbate child malnutrition and divert household funds away from food and other necessities. Further studies with a stronger analytic approach are needed. These results suggest that tobacco control should be part of public health strategies aimed at decreasing child malnutrition in developing countries.
Does trichostatin A prevent the accumulation of extracellular matrix in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis?,These findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of fibrosis.

Does current steering create additional pitch percepts in adult cochlear implant recipients?,These results indicate that additional pitch percepts can be created using current steering.
Is active transforming growth factor-beta2 increased in the aqueous humor of keratoconus patients?,The highest levels of active TGF-beta2 were found in keratoconus eyes. This finding might partly explain the excellent prognosis of keratoconus eyes regarding PK. Further (prospective) studies are being carried out to discover whether active TGF-beta2 might serve as predictive parameter for immune reactions following PK.
Does analysis of the RPE transcriptome reveal dynamic changes during the development of the outer blood-retinal barrier?,"The data reveal a far more dynamic view of the RPE and its interactions with its environment than would be expected from morphological examination. The remodeling of junctional complexes, extracellular matrix interactions and transcellular transport capabilities indicates a continuous remodeling of the blood-retinal barrier as the retina develops. These data provide a standard whereby culture models of RPE function and regulation may be judged."
Is lymphopenia associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations and disease activity in paediatric systemic lupus erythematosus patients?,Lymphopenia at SLE flares is associated with disease activity and organ damage. Marked lymphopenia is independently associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations.

DNA-image cytometry could help to find the appropriate treatment option for the patients and thus might improve their prognosis.
Do elevated serum S100B levels indicate a higher risk of hemorrhagic transformation after thrombolytic therapy in acute stroke?,"Elevated S100B serum levels before thrombolytic therapy constitute an independent risk factor for HT in patients with acute stroke. Unfortunately, the diagnostic accuracy of S100B is too low for it to function in this context as a reliable biomarker in clinical practice."
Does matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibition attenuate vascular endothelial growth factor-induced intracerebral hemorrhage?,"Vascular endothelial growth factor-induced ICH is associated with increased MMP-9 expression. Suppression of MMP-9 by minocycline or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate attenuated ICH, suggesting the therapeutic potential of MMP inhibitors in cerebral vascular rupture."
Does 1-year postactivation result for sequentially implanted bilateral cochlear implant users?,"Bilateral cochlear implantation allowed for better speech recognition in noise relative to unilateral performance for a group of 12 children who underwent sequential bilateral cochlear implantation at various ages. There was not a statistically significant relationship between speech recognition in noise benefit, which was defined as the difference in performance between the first implanted ear and the bilateral condition and the age at which the second implant was received. Children receiving bilateral cochlear implants younger than 4 years of age achieved better speech recognition in quiet performance for the later implanted ear as compared with children receiving their second cochlear implant after 4 year of age."
Are temporal summation of second pain and its maintenance useful for characterizing widespread central sensitization of fibromyalgia patients?,"The pain of FM seems to be accompanied by generalized central sensitization, involving the length of the spinal neuroaxis. Thus, widespread central sensitization appears to be a hallmark of FM and may be useful for the clinical case definition of this prevalent pain syndrome. In addition, measures of widespread central sensitization, like TSSP-M could also be used to assess treatment responses of FM patients."
Is high-risk human papillomavirus present in cytologically false-negative smears : an analysis of `` normal '' smears preceding CIN2/3?,"hrHPV is present in a high proportion of normal archival smears preceding CIN2/3, and false-negative cytology was highly associated with the presence of hrHPV. This supports the current notion that hrHPV testing can be used as a primary cervical screening tool. If so, hrHPV-positive cervical smears should be carefully examined for cytological abnormalities to reduce false-negative cervical cytology."
Are inflammatory biomarkers predictive of intermediate-term risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in stable CHF patients?,"No correlation was found between plasma levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, hsCRP and BNP and ventricular arrhythmic events among stable HF patients during an intermediate term follow-up of 5.1 months. Further studies are still required to assess the association between these biomarkers and long-term risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia."
Does pharmacological inhibition of CB1 cannabinoid receptor protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity?,These data suggest that CB1 antagonists may represent a new cardioprotective strategy against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
Is tumour location a prognostic factor for survival in colonic cancer patients?,"Colon cancer located in the transverse and descending colon is associated with poor prognosis. Comparison of results from different centres is difficult due to selection and classification differences, and different methods used for calculation of survival."
Does risk factors and correlate of snoring and observed apnea?,Exposure to biomass smoke in rural areas may account for the higher prevalence of snoring and observed apnea. Snoring intensity and observed apnea frequency may increase prevalence of traffic accidents along with many unfavorable symptoms.
Is immunochromatographic monoclonal test for detection of Helicobacter pylori antigen in stool useful in children from high-prevalence developing country?,"This test is useful for detecting H. pylori infection in children of all ages, and is a good alternative for screening studies in developing countries with elevated prevalence, due to its being fast, noninvasive, inexpensive, and easy to carry out."
Does toll-like receptor 2 impair host defense in gram-negative sepsis caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei ( Melioidosis )?,"Patients with melioidosis displayed an up-regulation of multiple TLRs in peripheral blood monocytes and granulocytes. Although both TLR2 and TLR4 contribute to cellular responsiveness to B. pseudomallei in vitro, TLR2 detects the LPS of B. pseudomallei, and only TLR2 impacts on the immune response of the intact host in vivo. Inhibition of TLR2 may be a novel treatment strategy in melioidosis."
Does obstetrician-assessed maternal health at pregnancy predict offspring future health?,"These findings demonstrate that a simple assessment of physical health (based on the appearance of eyes, skin, hair and teeth) of mothers at the time of pregnancy is a strong indicator of the future health risk of their offspring for common conditions that are associated with poor socioeconomic position and unhealthy behaviours. They do not support a specific biological link between maternal health across her life course and future risk of cardiovascular disease in her offspring."
Does depo-Provera abrogate attenuated lentivirus-induced protection in male rhesus macaques challenged intravenously with pathogenic SIVmac239?,Depo-Provera eliminates live-attenuated lentivirus vaccine efficacy in male rhesus monkeys through systemic effects on antiviral immunity and/or viral replication.
Do kindergarten children 's genetic vulnerabilities interact with friends ' aggression to promote children 's own aggression?,"Affiliation with aggressive friends at school entry is a significant environmental risk factor for aggression, especially for children genetically at risk for aggressive behaviors. Developmental models of aggression need to take into account both genetic liability and environmental factors in multiple settings, such as the peer context, to more precisely describe and understand the various developmental pathways to aggression. The implications for early prevention programs are discussed."
Is innate immune response to double-stranded RNA in biliary epithelial cells associated with the pathogenesis of biliary atresia?,"dsRNA viruses could directly induce the expression of TRAIL and apoptosis in human biliary epithelial cells as a result of the biliary innate immune response, supporting the notion that Reoviridae infections are directly associated with the pathogenesis of cholangiopathies in cases of BA."
"Are percentages of positive cores , cancer length and Gleason grade 4/5 cancer in systematic sextant biopsy all predictive of adverse pathology and biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy?",These results indicate that quantitative biopsy parameters are independent predictors of the adverse pathology of prostate cancers and disease recurrence after RP.

Are low TSH levels associated with osteoporosis in childhood?,"In childhood, chronic extremely low TSH levels, in the face of normal thyroid hormone levels, are not related to bone loss."
Does transfection with CD40L induce tumour suppression by dendritic cell activation in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma?,The induction of anti-tumour activity initiated after treating mice with the CD40L plasmid was achieved. Further investigations showed that this is mediated by mature myeloid dendritic cells which activate CD8 cells. Clinical trials investigating CD40L-based therapies should be extended.
Does a luteal estradiol protocol for expected poor-responders improve embryo number and quality?,"Giving estradiol in the luteal phase preceding IVF hyperstimulation increases the number and the quality of embryos achieved in patients deemed to have a poor response to IVF. Ultimately, this may translate into improved pregnancy outcomes in these patients."
Are vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in patients with hematologic malignancy : patients with acute myeloid leukemia at high-risk?,"Risk stratification for development of VRE infection is possible for patients with hematologic malignancy. Patients with AML represent a high-risk population, and targeted prevention strategies must include improved antibiotic stewardship, particularly judicious use of vancomycin therapy."
Does the effect of plastic overwraps on storage measures of red cell concentrate?,The use of plastic overwraps does not affect red cell quality markers in vitro.
Does use of the DiaMed Impact R to test platelet function in stored platelet concentrate?,We were able to reconstitute PCs by adding red cells and identified conditions to allow platelet adhesion and aggregation functions of PCs to be measurable in the DiaMed Impact R. Platelet functions of adhesion and aggregation were shown to decrease during storage but improved after a 1-h treatment at 37 degrees C.
Is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease a risk factor for type 2 diabetes in middle-aged Japanese men?,Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease significantly increases the risk of diabetes in middle-aged Japanese men.
Is [ Regression in primary cutaneous melanoma predictive for sentinel lymph node micrometastasis ]?,These data suggest that regression in primary cutaneous melanoma is not predictive for lymph node metastasis.
Do factors affecting fluid requirement on the first day after severe burn trauma?,Our data suggest that fluid requirement is higher than predicted by PF if the extent of burn or body mass index is low and less if the extent of burn or body mass index is high. The presence of deep burn increases fluid requirement.

"Is low cardiorespiratory fitness a strong predictor for clustering of cardiovascular disease risk factors in children independent of country , age and sex?","Low cardiorespiratory fitness is strongly associated with the clustering of CVD risk factors in children independent of country, age and sex."
Do glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha and 3 beta have distinct functions during cardiogenesis of zebrafish embryo?,"We conclude that (1) GSK3alpha, but not GSK3beta, is necessary in cardiomyocyte survival; (2) the GSK3beta plays important roles in modulating the left-right asymmetry and affecting heart positioning; and (3) GSK3alpha and GSK3beta play distinct roles during zebrafish cardiogenesis."
Is ischemia required for arteriogenesis in zebrafish embryos?,We conclude that NO and myeloid cell-dependent collateral vessel development is an evolutionarily ancient response to arterial occlusion and is able to proceed in the absence of ischemia.
Are superparamagnetic iron oxides and low molecular weight gadolinium chelates synergistic for direct visualization of advanced liver fibrosis?,"CCE imaging depicts advanced liver fibrosis with higher CNR than NE, Gd, or SPIO SGEs."
Does mucosal T-cell immunoregulation vary in early and late inflammatory bowel disease?,"At the onset of Crohn's disease mucosal T cells appear to mount a typical Th1 response that resembles an acute infectious process, and is lost with progression to late Crohn's disease. This suggests that mucosal T-cell immunoregulation varies with the course of human IBD. Patients with the initial manifestations of IBD may represent an ideal population in which immunomodulation may have optimal therapeutic efficacy."
Does strength training improve the tri-digit finger-pinch force control of older adults?,A nonspecific upper-limb strength-training program may improve the finger-pinch force control of older men.
Does intrauterine use of hyperconcentrated platelet concentrate collected with Trima Accel in a case of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia?,"HCPs collected with TA are a useful alternative to washed standard PLT concentrates without the need for further manipulation of the product after collection. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed, however, to make definite recommendations for the shelf life of these HCP."
Are plasma concentrations of the HIV-protease inhibitor lopinavir suboptimal in children aged 2 years and below?,"Mean LPV pharmacokinetic parameters in these HIV-infected children are similar to published data, but exposure is significantly reduced in children <2 years. Prospective pharmacokinetic studies using 300/75 mg/m2 LPV/r in this age population are urgently warranted."
Does promise and problems with supply chain management approach to health care purchasing?,"Current individual efforts to coordinate the health care supply chain do not act on all of the actors necessary to improve outcomes, promote safety, and control costs. Nevertheless, there are indications that several of the individual efforts are coming together. If national efforts touching on all critical elements can coordinate with purchasers, then the health care supply chain's performance may improve significantly."
Do delay of first treatment of mental and substance use disorders in Mexico?,Failure to make prompt initial treatment contact is an important reason explaining why there are unmet needs for mental health care in Mexico. Meeting these needs will likely require expansion and optimal allocation of resources as well as other interventions.
Do location and type of mutation in the LIS1 gene predict phenotypic severity?,"In contrast to previous reports, our data suggest that neither type nor position of intragenic mutations in the LIS1 gene allows an unambiguous prediction of the phenotypic severity. Furthermore, patients presenting with mild cerebral malformations such as subcortical band heterotopia or cerebellar hypoplasia should be considered for genetic analysis of the LIS1 gene."
Does donepezil preserve cognition and global function in patients with severe Alzheimer disease?,Patients with severe AD demonstrated greater efficacy compared to placebo on measures of cognition and global function.
Does rapamycin prevent early steps of the development of diabetic nephropathy in rats?,"Rapamycin treatment can prevent the early renal structural changes of diabetes in experimental rats, and thus halt the early steps of the development of diabetic nephropathy. mTOR blockade might be beneficial for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy."
Does [ Evaluation of glaucoma progression by means of HRT II result ]?,"In spite of local medical therapy and stabilization of IOP values, in advanced stages of glaucoma, the progression of the disease occurred. The 3 years follow up period was too short to reveal any significant changes in the ONH topography in the group with ocular hypertension. HRT II was a reproducible method in the follow up of structural changes of the ONH in all evaluated groups."
Does genome-wide analysis of ABA-responsive elements ABRE and CE3 reveal divergent patterns in Arabidopsis and rice?,"Our computational analyses revealed distinct recruitment patterns of ABA-responsive CREs in upstream sequences of Arabidopsis and rice. The apparent absence of CE3s in Arabidopsis suggests that another CE pairs with ABRE to establish a functional ABRC capable of interacting with transcription factors. Further studies will be needed to test whether the observed differences are extrapolatable to monocots and dicots in general, and to understand how they contribute to the fine-tuning of the hormonal response. The outcome of our investigation can now be used to direct future experimentation designed to further dissect the ABA-dependent regulatory networks."
Does exon expression profiling reveal stimulus-mediated exon use in neural cells?,"Our findings connect extracellular stimuli to specific exon behavior, and suggest that changes in transcript and exon abundance are reflective of a coordinated gene expression response to elevated [Ca2+]i. The technology we describe here lends itself readily to the resolution of stimulus-induced gene expression at both the transcript and exon levels."
Does the magnitude of early response to methotrexate therapy predict long-term outcome of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis?,Our results show that the achievement of an ACR Pediatric 70 response at 6 months after start of MTX therapy predicts a more favorable long-term outcome of patients with JIA.
Does alpha-1 antitrypsin Z protein ( PiZ ) increase hepatic fibrosis in a murine model of cholestasis?,"PiZ transgenic mice are more susceptible to liver fibrosis induced by cholestasis from BDL. Cholestasis therefore may lead to increased fibrosis in alpha1-AT deficiency, and the alpha1-ATZ mutation may act as a modifier gene in patients with concurrent cholestatic liver diseases such as cystic fibrosis."
Does the antero-posterior diameter of the lumbar dural sac predict sensory levels of spinal anesthesia for Cesarean delivery?,"The lumbar DSD, as determined by ultrasound, is not a predictor of spinal anesthesia spread. Further research is necessary to understand if ultrasound findings can be used to predict intrathecal spread of local anesthetics."
Does human immunodeficiency type-1 virus ( HIV-1 ) infection in serodiscordant couples ( SDCs ) have an impact on embryo quality or intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) outcome?,HIV-1 infection in SDCs with infected males does not appear to have a significantly negative impact on embryo development or ICSI outcome.

Is p15 ( INK4B ) and E-cadherin CpG island methylation frequent in Egyptian acute myeloid leukemia?,"These results demonstrate that p15 and E-cadherin promoter methylation are frequent events in Egyptian AML and provide an impetus for larger studies to define the extent and pattern of methylation in the various subgroups of AML. Methylation studies, therefore, represent a novel additional tool to define the subset of patients who might benefit from demethylating agents,thus providing the molecular basis for targeted therapeutic approaches and better designing of risk-adapted therapy."
"Do endocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas : grading , tumor size and proliferation index predict malignant behavior?","The findings suggest that tumor size, tumor grade and Ki-67 index do not accurately predict malignant behavior of GIP ETs."
Does at clinically relevant concentrations the anaesthetic/amnesic thiopental but not the anticonvulsant phenobarbital interfere with hippocampal sharp wave-ripple complexes?,"We hypothesize that thiopental, by interfering with SPW-R activity, through enhancement of the GABAA receptor-mediated transmission, affects memory processes which involve hippocampal circuit activation. The quantity but not the frequency of ripple oscillation was affected by the drug."
"Is coupling between neuronal firing rate , gamma LFP , and BOLD fMRI related to interneuronal correlations?","Our results offer a resolution to a central controversy regarding the coupling between neurons, LFP, and BOLD signals by demonstrating, for the first time, that the coupling of single units to the other measures is variable yet it is tightly related to the degree of interneuronal correlations in the human auditory cortex."
Do eGFR associated expression profiles vary with breast tumor subtype?,"These results suggest that breast basal-like cell lines are sensitive to EGFR inhibitors and carboplatin, and this combination may also be synergistic. In vivo, the EGFR-signatures were of prognostic value, were associated with tumor subtype, and were uniquely associated with the high expression of distinct EGFR-RAS-MEK pathway genes."
Does enteric glial-derived S100B protein stimulate nitric oxide production in celiac disease?,Enteric glial-derived S100B is increased in the duodenum of patients with celiac disease and plays a role in nitric oxide production.
Does tumor lymphangiogenesis correlate with lymph node metastasis and clinicopathologic parameters in oral squamous cell carcinoma?,Lymphangiogenesis predominantly influenced metastasis-free survival. The current results suggested that LVD is a more useful tool than MVD and VEGF-C for deciding on therapeutic strategies in patients with OSCC.
Is magnetoencephalography more successful for screening and localizing frontal lobe epilepsy than electroencephalography?,The automated procedures developed in this study provide a fast screening method for identifying the distinct categories of spikes and the brain areas responsible for these spikes. The results show that MEG spike yield and localization is superior compared with EEG. This finding is of importance for the diagnosis and preoperative evaluation of patients with frontal lobe epilepsy.
Do different strategies moderate primary motor cortex involvement in mental rotation : a TMS study?,"This finding suggests that M1 involvement is not exclusively linked with the use of the internal strategy but rather directly with the process of mental rotation. Alternatively, our results might support the hypothesis that M1 is active due to a 'spill-over' effect from adjacent brain regions."
Does protein glutathionylation increase in the liver of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?,"Protein glutathionylation significantly increases in livers with NAFLD, strongly suggesting that oxidative injury plays a crucial role in this disease. Furthermore, the marked increase of protein glutathionylation, in correlation with collagen VI immunoreactivity, suggests a link between the redox status of hepatic protein thiols and fibrosis."
Do long-term follow-up results of pars plana vitrectomy for diabetic macular edema?,"The results indicate that the improvement in the BCVA is attained by 12 months postvitrectomy, and is maintained for at least 24 months. The reduction in RT can be maintained for up to 24 months. The results also indicate that vitrectomy should be performed when the preoperative BCVA is >0.05 at worst."
Does an immune response gene expression module identify a good prognosis subtype in estrogen receptor negative breast cancer?,"We show that ER-negative basal breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with at least four main subtypes. Furthermore, we show that the heterogeneity in clinical outcome of ER-negative breast cancer is related to the variability in expression levels of complement and immune response pathway genes, independent of lymphocytic infiltration."
Does serial magnetic resonance imaging correlate with neurological outcome in an experimental model of spinal cord ischemia?,"Findings on MR imaging can differentiate clinical outcomes in this experimental model of spinal cord ischemia. While further studies are required, MR could be useful in predicting which patients are at risk for delayed paraplegia after TAA repair."
Do cDNA sequences reveal considerable gene prediction inaccuracy in the Plasmodium falciparum genome?,"Our data indicated that approximately 24% of the genes in the current databases were predicted incorrectly, although some of these inaccuracies could represent alternatively spliced transcripts, and that more genes than currently predicted have one or more additional introns. It is therefore necessary to annotate the parasite genome with experimental data, although obtaining complete cDNA sequences from this parasite will be a formidable task due to the high AT nature of the genome. This study provides valuable information for genome annotation that will be critical for functional analyses."
Is high prepregnant body mass index associated with early termination of full and any breastfeeding in Danish women?,"These findings extend the observation to a broader range of BMIs that the greater the prepregnant BMI, the earlier the termination of breastfeeding. Together with the fact that this association was evident in a more supportive social context for breastfeeding, these findings suggest a biological basis for the association."
Do older adults who use vitamin/mineral supplements differ from nonusers in nutrient intake adequacy and dietary attitudes?,"A large proportion of older adults do not consume sufficient amounts of many nutrients from foods alone. Supplements compensate to some extent, but only an estimated half of this population uses them daily. These widespread inadequacies should be considered when developing recommendations for supplement use for clients in this age group. Modifying dietary attitudes may result in a higher rate of supplement use in this at-risk population."
Is malnutrition inflammation score associated with coronary artery disease in hepatitis C virus-infected hemodialysis patients?,MIS may be associated with CAD in anti-HCV-positive HD patients.
Is tumor sclerosis but not cell proliferation or malignancy grade a prognostic marker in advanced-stage follicular lymphoma : the German Low Grade Lymphoma Study Group?,"The presence of sclerosis within the lymphoma is a marker of poor overall survival that is independent of the FLIPI. The quantification of macrophage or absolute T-cell content, grading, and proliferation are of no help in predicting the outcome of FL. Future studies need to identify surrogate markers for the prognostic immune signatures identified by gene expression profiling. Most importantly, new prognostic markers need to be confirmed in patients treated within prospective trials."
Does cost-effectiveness of the surveillance program of hepatocellular carcinoma depend on the medical circumstances?,"The gain in QALYs and the ICER due to the surveillance of HCC varies between different patient subgroups and it critically depends on the rate of small HCC detected incidentally without surveillance, as well as the annual incidence of HCC and the adoption of liver transplantation."
Is sOX9 required for the differentiation of paneth cells in the intestinal epithelium?,We conclude that SOX9 is required for the differentiation of Paneth cells. Our results elucidate an essential step in the differentiation of gut epithelium.
Do n-glycan structures and associated gene expression reflect the characteristic N-glycosylation pattern of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells?,Our work presents new information on the characters of HSPCs. The new knowledge of HSPC-specific N-glycosylation advances their identification and provides tools to promote HSPC homing and mobilization or targeting to specific tissues.
Is association of interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 genotypes with radiographic damage in rheumatoid arthritis dependent on autoantibody status?,"The reported associations of IL-6 -174G with high IL-6 production and IL-10 -592 with low IL-10 production and our own results support a role of genetically determined dysregulated cytokine production in disease severity. The lack of association of these genotypes with RF and anti-CCP antibody status suggests that they act downstream of autoantibody production. We conclude that IL-6 and IL-10 genotypes may be useful in predicting disease severity in autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative patients, respectively."
Does [ Assessment of risk of fall in the elderly through a screening protocol in primary care ]?,"The protocol is useful for the detection of elderly individuals at risk of falling, since most of the variables showed a statistically significant relationship with falls. Application of this protocol should be encouraged."
Does growth hormone ( GH ) treatment reduce peripheral thyroid hormone action in girls with Turner syndrome?,GH treatment reduced TR expression in PBMC and biochemical serum markers of TH action. These results suggest that GH treatment in TS patients impair peripheral TH action at tissue level and prompt a role in the reduced growth response to the therapy.
Are her2 and progesterone receptor status predictive of response to fulvestrant treatment?,"Response rate and time to progression are shown to be independent of Her2 status, grading, and progesterone receptor status. This is probably caused by the unique mechanism of action associated with fulvestrant: Due to receptor down-regulation, it blocks nuclear, cytoplasmatic, and membrane-bound estrogen receptor. Therefore, it seems to inhibit the cross-talk between growth factor receptor signaling and estrogen receptor in a more effective manner."
Is tNFSF15 an ethnic-specific IBD gene?,"We observed a protective haplotype, consisting of the minor alleles for all 5 markers, to have a higher frequency in the non-Jewish controls than in CD and UC. Of further interest, the haplotype frequency was in the opposite direction in our Jewish case-control panels (both CD and UC), leading us to conclude 1) that TNFSF15 is indeed an IBD susceptibility gene, and 2) the disease susceptibility is ethnic-specific."
Are speech delay and autism spectrum behaviors frequently associated with duplication of the 7q11.23 Williams-Beuren syndrome region?,"Array-based comparative genomic hybridization is a powerful means of detecting genomic imbalances and identifying molecular etiologies in the clinic setting, including genomic disorders such as Williams-Beuren syndrome and dup(7)(q11.23). We propose that dup(7)(q11.23) syndrome may be as frequent as Williams-Beuren syndrome and a previously unrecognized cause of language delay and behavioral abnormalities. Indeed, these individuals may first be referred for evaluation of autism, even if they do not ultimately meet diagnostic criteria for an autism spectrum disorder."
Is prognostic significance of atrial fibrillation a function of left ventricular ejection fraction?,The effect of AF on mortality diminishes with worsening LV function and is absent in those with severe LV dysfunction. Susceptibility of patients with QT prolongation to AF mortality warrants further attention.
Do [ The comparison of selected spirometric parameters with functional muscles exercise evaluation in patients with myasthenia ]?,In patients with myasthenia of type I and II the weakness of upper extremities muscles correlates with decreased PEF value in spirometry. In addition in ocular myasthenia decreased FVC value was observed more often in patients with positive results of test of the functional muscles estimation.
Does large-scale integration of cancer microarray data identify a robust common cancer signature?,"By combining the TSPG method and repeated random sampling, a robust common cancer signature has been identified from large-scale microarray data integration. Upon further validation, this signature may be useful as a robust and objective diagnostic test for cancer."
Is transmission-blocking activity induced by malaria vaccine candidates Pfs25/Pvs25 a direct and predictable function of antibody titer?,ELISA data may be used as a surrogate for the MFA to evaluate transmission-blocking vaccine efficacy. This will facilitate the evaluation of transmission-blocking vaccines and implementation of this malaria control strategy.
Does morphometric analysis of the inferior alveolar nerve fail to demonstrate sexual dimorphism?,We assumed that the sex difference in the incidence of IAN damage was not affected by the morphometric findings. Our findings might partly explain why there is no significant sex difference in the incidence of IAN damage.
Does hepatic venous pressure gradient predict clinical decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhosis?,"HVPG, MELD, and albumin independently predict clinical decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Patients with an HVPG <10 mm Hg have a 90% probability of not developing clinical decompensation in a median follow-up of 4 years."
Are stroke symptoms in individuals reporting no prior stroke or transient ischemic attack associated with a decrease in indices of mental and physical functioning?,"Individuals with clinically consistent symptoms but no stroke diagnosis have a lower quality of life than those without symptoms. The difference in physical functioning is substantial with a smaller decline in mental functioning. Apart from so-called ""silent stroke,"" there appear to be many individuals with possibly symptomatic cerebrovascular disease-either stroke or transient ischemic attack-who are not being diagnosed. Furthermore, these symptomatic but undiagnosed strokes may not be benign."
Is deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic area more effective than nucleus ventralis intermedius stimulation for bilateral intention tremor?,"Direct comparison of different stimulation sites in individual patients revealed that DBS in the subthalamic area is more effective in suppressing pharmacoresistant intention tremor than the ventro-lateral thalamus proper. Anatomical structures possibly involved in tremor suppression include cerebello-thalamic projections, the prelemniscal radiation, and the zona incerta."
Does mutation and citrullination modify vimentin to a novel autoantigen for rheumatoid arthritis?,"Antigenic properties of vimentin were determined by mutation and citrullination. Anti-MCV antibodies are a novel diagnostic marker for RA. Furthermore, they may allow monitoring and-if confirmed in even larger series of patients-stratification of disease."
Do emblica officinalis and its enriched tannoids delay streptozotocin-induced diabetic cataract in rats?,The results provide evidence that Emblica and an enriched fraction of Emblica tannoids are effective in delaying development of diabetic cataract in rats.
Does venous thromboembolism predict poor prognosis in irresectable pancreatic cancer patients?,Our data suggest that the occurrence of VTE may be associated with a reduced response rate and a shorter PFS and OS among patients with irresectable pancreatic cancer. In these patients the development of VTE may reflect the presence of a biologically more aggressive cancer that in turn leads to a worse prognosis.
Does [ Synthesized small interfering RNA inhibit the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma ]?,The effective siRNA which could inhibited the expression of DNMT-1 of ACC were achieved. The inhibition effect of RNAi was time-dependent and dose-dependent.
Does noninvasive imaging predict failure load of the spine with simulated osteolytic defects?,"Although current clinical guidelines for predicting fracture risk are based on geometric measurements of the defect, we have shown that the relative size of the defect alone does not account for the variation in vertebral yield loads. However, composite beam theory analysis with quantitative computed tomography-derived measures of rigidity can be used to prospectively predict the yield loads of vertebrae with lytic defects."
"Is l-Ephedrine a major constituent of Mao-Bushi-Saishin-To , one of the formulas of Chinese medicine , which shows immediate inhibition after oral administration of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats?","It is strongly emphasised that the rapid suppression of PCA by orally administered l-ephedrine must be exerted by a mechanism distinct from that of suppression produced following gastrointestinal absorption of the drug, because the time required for the inhibition was extraordinarily short. However, direct inhibition of anaphylactic histamine release from isolated mast cells was excluded in this inhibition of PCA."
Does modified irinotecan hydrochloride ( CPT-11 ) administration schedule improve induction of delayed-onset diarrhea in rats?,These results suggested that the duration of exposure to both CPT-11 and SN-38 of the intestinal epithelium and CPT-11 plasma Cmax are closely related to the incidence and severity of CPT-11-induced delayed-onset diarrhea in rats.
Do small concomitant vascular lesions influence rates of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer disease?,This clinicopathologic correlation study suggests that concomitant small cerebral infarcts with a total volume of less than 10 cm(3) do not significantly influence the overall rate of global cognitive decline in patients with AD. Arch Neurol. 2000;57:1474-1479
Does helicobacter pylori-associated gastric ulcer exhibit enhanced mucosal chemokine activity at the ulcer site?,Mucosal alpha- and beta-chemokines may be important to the ulcerogenesis in H. pylori-associated GU disease.
Does systolic anterior motion begin at low left ventricular outflow tract velocity in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"Systolic anterior motion begins at normal LVOT velocity. At SAM onset, though Venturi forces are present in the outflow tract, their magnitude is much smaller than previously assumed; the Venturi mechanism cannot explain SAM. These velocity data, along with shape, orientation and temporal observations in patients, indicate that drag, the pushing force of flow, is the dominant hydrodynamic force that causes SAM."
Are indirect estimates of body composition useful for groups but unreliable in individuals?,"BMI was a poor surrogate for body fatness in both males and females. The currently recommended equations for the prediction of body composition from SFT and BIA provided inaccurate estimates of FFM both at the individual and group level as compared to estimates from DD. However, Heitmann's equations, when combined with measures of the biceps SFT and mid-arm circumference, provided better estimates of FFM both at the individual and group level."
"Is combined seropositivity for H. pylori and C. pneumoniae associated with age , obesity and social factors?","Subjects with combined positive serology for H. pylori and C. pneumoniae are characterized by greater age, lower social class and higher BMI, as well as higher fasting levels of insulin than those of seronegative subjects. Obesity might be a marker not only for lower social class but also for greater than normal susceptibility to such infections."
Are solitary fibrous tumors immunophenotypically distinct from mesothelioma ( s )?,"The histogenesis of solitary fibrous tumor remains elusive. It is unlikely that tumor location or tumor de-differentiation accounts for the dichotomous staining properties, as these neoplasms show a similarly benign histologic appearance regardless of location."
Does dynamic helical computed tomography scan accurately detect hemorrhage in patients with pelvic fracture?,Early use of dynamic helical CT scanning in the multiply injured patient with a pelvic fracture accurately identifies the need for emergent angiographic embolization.
Is physician leadership essential to the survival of teaching hospitals?,"Physicians must educate themselves on forces impacting the AMC, understand changes needed in the structure and processes of AMC governance and acquire competencies for leadership and management if AMCs are to survive and thrive. Surgeons should acquire competencies that will enable them to become leaders in the process of AMC transformation."
"Is the maize major allergen , which responsible for food-induced allergic reactions , is a lipid transfer protein?","The major allergen of maize is an LTP with a molecular weight of 9 kd that is highly homologous with the peach LTP, the major allergen of the Prunoideae subfamily."
Does temporal association between hospitalization and rate of fall after discharge?,"The rate of falls is substantially increased in the first month after medical hospitalization, and is an important cause of injury and morbidity. Posthospital risk factors may be potentially modifiable. Efforts to assess and modify risk factors should be integral to the hospital and posthospital care of older adults (those aged >/=65 years)."
Does genomic DNA methylation decrease in response to moderate folate depletion in elderly women?,DNA methylation status may be used as a functional indicator of moderately depleted folate status. The slow response to the repletion diets observed suggests that normalization of DNA methylation after moderate folate depletion may be delayed in older women.
Is general non-specific morbidity reduced after vaccination within the third month of life -- the Greifswald study?,"Our study revealed that children who received vaccination against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HiB and poliomyelitis simultaneously within the third month of life do not exhibit enhanced frequencies of infectious disease-associated symptoms. In contrary, the frequencies of infection-associated symptoms were found to be significantly reduced. This might be caused by a vaccination-associated unspecific enhancement of immunological activity (e.g. mediated by interleukin 2) or by other presently still unknown factors."
Does [ Isolated tumor cells in bone marrow predict reduced survival in lymph node-negative non-small-cell lung cancer ]?,"Minimal residual bone marrow involvement is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with node-negative NSCLC, which may help to identify patients in need of an adjuvant systemic therapy. The postoperative persistence or re-appearance of tumor cells in bone marrow indicates that these are not only shredded cells but rather represent true micrometastasis."
Do the effect of cochlear implant use in postlingually deaf adults?,"All three questionnaires detected improvements in HRQOL due to CI use. To make a detailed assessment of the effect of a CI on functional outcomes and well-being, a special purpose HRQOL instrument is far more adequate than a general HRQOL instrument. This study also showed that a CI affects several other health domains besides auditory performance. The effect of CI use on general functioning and well-being proved to be considerable."
Does depression of retinal glutamate transporter function lead to elevated intravitreal glutamate levels and ganglion cell death?,These results demonstrate that normal function of EAAT1 and EAAT2 is necessary for retinal ganglion cell survival and plays an important role in retinal excitotoxicity. Manipulation of retinal glutamate transporter expression may become a useful tool in understanding retinal neuronal loss.
Is retinal degeneration slowed in transgenic rats by AAV-mediated delivery of FGF-2?,"Transduction of retinal cells with AAV-FGF-2 reduces the rate of photoreceptor degeneration in an S334ter-4 animal model. Despite the lack of significantly increased ERG amplitudes from eyes expressing FGF-2, a greater number of surviving photoreceptors was demonstrated. Delivery of FGF-2 using recombinant AAV has potential as a therapy for retinal degeneration."
Does chronic valproate treatment increase expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins in the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus?,"Because GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin possess molecular chaperone activity and bind Ca(2+) in the endoplasmic reticulum, the pharmacologic action of valproate may involve one or more of these processes."
"Is sedation for colonoscopy using a single bolus safe , effective , and efficient : a prospective , randomized , double-blind trial?","Rapid bolus sedation for colonoscopy saves significant endoscopist time, is associated with less O2 desaturation, and provides equivalent levels of patient comfort. A revision of the guidelines for sedation and analgesia during endoscopy should be considered."
Does visual field result after vitreous surgery in a case series of patients with open-angle glaucoma?,The results of our small case series suggest that vitrectomy may be an acceptable intervention in eyes with glaucoma and co-existing macular problems.
Is ( 13 ) C-urea breath test without a test meal highly accurate for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infection in Chinese?,This simplified (13)C-UBT protocol without a test meal produced highly accurate and reliable results in the Chinese population.
Is the colorectal tumour suppressor APC present in the NMDA-receptor-PSD-95 complex in the brain?,"Our findings suggest that the PSD-95-NMDA-R-APC complex forms due to the multimerization of PSD-95 monomers, each of which can associate with either NMDA-R or APC. It is possible that APC is involved in the regulation of ion channel clustering and/or organization of signalling molecules."
Do clinical nutrition managers have access to sources of empowerment?,"Clinical nutrition managers are empowered and able to assume leadership roles in today's health care settings. Their power may be enhanced by asserting more pressure to gain greater access to sources of power: support, information, resources, and opportunities."
Does collagen-embedded platelet-derived growth factor DNA plasmid promote wound healing in a dermal ulcer model?,PDGF DNA gene therapy is effective at accelerating wound healing in ischemic dermal ulcers and provides a viable alternative to peptide growth factor therapy.
Do whole mounted radical prostatectomy specimens increase detection of adverse pathological features?,Whole mounted sampling of the radical prostatectomy specimen does not improve detection of adverse pathological features.
Do wet smear compared with gram stain diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women?,"In asymptomatic pregnant women, bacterial vaginosis can be diagnosed reliably by Gram stain."
Does caffeine decrease the occurrence of cadmium-induced forelimb ectrodactyly in C57BL/6J mice?,This study provides evidence that a subteratogenic dose of caffeine can ameliorate cadmium-induced forelimb ectrodactyly in the Cd-sensitive C57BL/6J inbred mouse strain.
Is hydroxylamine moiety of developmental toxicants associated with early cell death : a structure-activity analysis?,These results are consistent with the concept that the rapidly occurring embryonic cytotoxicity induced by hydroxylamine-bearing compounds involves a free radical mechanism that requires the presence of a terminal hydroxylamine group for initiation.
Is cyanocobalamin absorption abnormality in alcoholics improved by oral supplementation with a fermented papaya-derived antioxidant?,"It can be postulated that the antioxidative action played by Bionormalizer, possibly due to its availability substrates for glutathione synthesis as well as to its effects on local oxidative burst from neutrophil, is able to recover a normal cobalamin absorption."
"Is asthma more prevalent in rural New South Wales than metropolitan Victoria , Australia?",These results suggest that asthma is more prevalent in rural southern New South Wales than in Melbourne but follows a different pattern of exacerbations.
Does maternal social support predict birth weight and fetal growth in human pregnancy?,"These findings suggest that prenatal social support is associated with infant birth weight through processes involving fetal growth rather than those involving timing of delivery. Biological and behavioral factors may contribute to the association between support and fetal growth, although these mechanisms need to be further explored. These results pave the way for additional research on fetal growth mechanisms and provide a basis for support intervention research."
Does a positive caver map response poorly predict recovery of potency after radical prostatectomy?,"A positive CaverMap response, suggesting that a successful nerve-sparing prostatectomy had been performed, was obtained in 77% of the NVBs tested. Nevertheless, with a median follow-up of 12 months, most patients with a positive CaverMap response remained impotent. This suggests that other factors are critical to the recovery of sexual function after radical prostatectomy."
Is per-gram cost of medication by itself a poor indicator for comparing costs of different psoriasis treatments : a retrospective cohort study of the cost of psoriasis treatment with topical corticosteroids versus topical calcipotriene?,"The per-gram cost of medication is by itself a poor indicator for comparing the cost of different psoriasis treatment regimens. Given the greater safety and efficacy of combination regimens in terms of both short-term improvement and long-term control, initiating psoriasis treatment with a combination regimen of topical calcipotriene combined with an ultrapotent corticosteroid appears to be the most cost-effective approach to psoriasis treatment."
Is serum level of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II ( sTNF-R75 ) apparently an index of overall monocyte-related infectious and inflammatory activity?,"Our results, together with those of recent reports showing positive correlations between the serum sTNF-R75 level and activities/severities of different infectious and inflammatory diseases, and also that TNF-alpha is principally produced by monocytes and macrophages, suggest that the serum sTNF-R75 level is very probably an index of overall monocyte-related infectious and inflammatory activities."
Does hRG4 ( UNC119 ) mutation found in cone-rod dystrophy cause retinal degeneration in a transgenic model?,"HRG4, the only synaptic protein known to be highly enriched in photoreceptor ribbon synapses, is now shown to be pathogenic when mutated."
Is predisposition to colonic dysplasia unaffected by continuous administration of insulin-like growth factor-I for twenty weeks in a rat model of chronic inflammatory bowel disease?,Twenty weeks administration of IGF-I to rats induced growth of the intestine but did not affect the severity of experimentally-induced colitis or the incidence or progression of colonic dysplasia.
Is the detection of colorectal cancer at an asymptomatic stage by screening useful?,"Screening using fecal occult blood testing, colonoscopy and tumor markers is thus considered to be beneficial for the early detection of colorectal carcinoma, which also tends to demonstrate good surgical results."
Are automated cardiac output measurements by ultrasound inaccurate at high cardiac outputs?,"The ACM is not an accurate tool to measure cardiac output in patients with a high cardiac output, including treated pre-eclamptic women."
Does shockwave frequency affect fragmentation in a kidney stone model?,"The number of shocks required to fragment a stone is influenced in part by the frequency at which the shockwaves are delivered. Increasing the shockwave frequency from 60 to 117 per minute in this study caused a significant rise in the number of shocks required to break the stone. The pressure output of the electrode was similar at the frequencies tested, thus making the difference in stone fragmentation secondary to the mechanism of stone disintegration and not the function of the electrode."
Do clinical nutrition and foodservice personnel in teaching hospitals have different perceptions of total quality management performance?,"As the dynamic roles of dietitians change, many dietitians will occupy management positions in organizations such as restaurants, health food stores, food processing/distribution companies, and schools. This study demonstrates how a TQM survey instrument could be applied to clinical nutrition and foodservice settings. Dietitians will need to assess TQM in their workplace facilities, especially because of the direct links of TQM to productivity and client satisfaction."
Are stroke and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 independent risk factors for cognitive decline : A population-based study?,Stroke and ApoE epsilon4 may impair cognition through distinct nonsynergistic mechanisms. The slowing of information processing speed for ApoE epsilon4 carriers was more evident than impairment in memory.
Does carotid artery intima-media thickness measured by ultrasonography in normal clinical practice correlate well with atherosclerosis risk factors?,These observations establish a strong correlation between B-mode imaging of carotid atherosclerosis evaluated in normal clinical practice and data provided by clinical trials and validate this simple reading technique as a means of identifying IMT as another possible risk factor in patients at high risk of vascular disease.
Does the risk assessment profile score identify trauma patients at risk for deep vein thrombosis?,"The RAP score correctly identified trauma patients at increased risk for the development of DVT. Despite prophylaxis, the high-risk group warrants surveillance scans. Withholding prophylaxis in low-risk patients can reduce hospital charges without risk."
Is the highly malignant phenotype of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines recessive?,"Taken together, these findings suggest that the highly malignant phenotype of the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is achieved by the impairment of gene functions that negatively regulate cell growth, rather than by the activation of dominant oncogenes."
Does availability of content information improve performance on computerized case simulations?,The data demonstrate no evidence that prior knowledge of content area influences the scores of successive classes on computerized models of performance assessment.
Are thyroid stimulating hormone levels in cord blood influenced by non-thyroidal mothers ' diseases?,"Our results indicate that primary TSH screening programs using cord blood are not affected by maternal diseases. We suggest that, besides its technical advantages over heel punctures with T4 primary approaches, neonatal screening using primary cord blood TSH may also be used as a monitoring tool for evaluation and control of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD)."
Do lymph node micrometastases predict relapse in stage II colon cancer?,Micrometastases to histologically uninvolved mesenteric lymph nodes commonly are detected in patients with pT3 or pT4 colonic adenocarcinomas on recuts stained immunohistochemically for keratin. Nodal micrometastases detected by immunohistochemical staining are not useful for identifying stage II patients at higher risk for relapse.
Does air pollution in Calcutta elicit adverse pulmonary reaction in children?,The study demonstrated that children inhaling grossly polluted air of Calcutta suffer from adverse lung reactions and genetic abnormality in the exposed tissues.
Does repetitive bilateral arm training with rhythmic auditory cueing improve motor function in chronic hemiparetic stroke?,-Six weeks of BATRAC improves functional motor performance of the paretic upper extremity as well as a few changes in isometric strength and range of motion. These benefits are largely sustained at 8 weeks after training cessation.
Is histopathologic evidence that sacroiliitis in ankylosing spondylitis merely enthesitis?,"In the sacroiliitis of AS, two findings predominate: 1) synovitis and subchondral bone marrow changes offer a more rational explanation for widespread joint destruction than does enthesitis; and 2) an unusual form of chondroid metaplasia contributes to ankylosis."
Does a full-UV spectrum absorbing daily use cream protect human skin against biological changes occurring in photoaging?,"Our results show in vivo that an appropriate full-UV spectrum product significantly reduces the solar-UV-induced skin damage, demonstrating the benefit of daily photoprotection."
Does cerebral intravascular oxygenation correlate with mean arterial pressure in critically ill premature infants?,"We conclude that NIRS can be used in a noninvasive manner at the bedside to identify premature infants with impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation, that this impairment is relatively common in such infants, and that the presence of this impairment is associated with a high likelihood of occurrence of severe GMH-IVH/PVL."
Does electroencephalogram approximate entropy correctly classify the occurrence of burst suppression pattern as increasing anesthetic drug effect?,"Electroencephalogram approximate entropy, but not electroencephalogram median frequency or spectral edge frequency 95 without burst compensation, correctly classifies the occurrence of burst-suppression pattern as increasing anesthetic drug effect."
Is sentinel lymph node biopsy accurate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer?,SLN biopsy is accurate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The SLN identification improved with experience. False-negative findings occurred at a low rate throughout the series. This technique is a potential way to guide the axillary treatment of patients who are clinically node negative after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Does the choice of embryo transfer catheter affect embryo implantation after IVF?,The choice of ET catheter may affect the success of IVF-ET cycles. Use of the Tomcat catheter compared with the TDT catheter seems to result in significantly better efficiency of the ET procedure and is more cost effective.
Is pain significantly reduced by cryoablation therapy in patients with lateral minithoracotomy?,Cryoablation is easy to perform and leads to a significant reduction in pain and lower request for additional pain medication after lateral minithoracotomy in minimally invasive cardiac operation.
Does early childhood heart rate predict externalizing behavior problems at age 7 years?,"In this sample, heart rate does not predict externalizing behavior at age 7."
Does incidence of post-endoscopic retrograde-cholangiopancreatography/sphincterotomy pancreatitis depend upon definition criteria?,The incidence of post-procedure pancreatitis ranged from 1.9% to 11.7% depending on the definition criteria adopted.
Does increasing age affect time to appropriate therapy in primary prevention ICD/CRT-D : a competing risks analysis?,"Age has no impact on the time to appropriate therapy, but risk of death prior to therapy increases by 6% for every year increment. As the ICD population ages, the proportion who die without receiving appropriate therapy increases due to competing risks. Characterizing competing risks predictive of death independent of ICD indication would focus therapy on those with potential to benefit and reduce unnecessary exposure to ICD-related morbidity."
Do ocular blood flow values measured by laser speckle flowgraphy correlate with the postmenstrual age of normal neonates?,Our results clarified that the values of ocular blood flow measured by LSFG correlate with the postmenstrual age of normal neonates.
Does target lesion response predict survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma retreated with transarterial chemoembolization?,"Compared to patients with TNP, patients with TP might exhibit no improvement in survival and even present damaged liver function after retreatment with TACE. Target lesion response is useful as a clinical decision for repeated TACE in these patients."
Does the count of tender rather than swollen joints correlate with aortic stiffness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis?,"In RA patients the number of tender, rather than swollen joints correlates with stiffness of the aorta, as measured through cfPWV. Therefore, RA associated joint pain might play a role in the development of aortic stiffness and thus increase CV risk."
Does proteoform profiling of peripheral blood serum proteins from pregnant women provide a molecular IUGR signature?,"Identification of IUGR newborns in the case room is required as children are severely diseased and need specialized care during infancy. Yet, at time of birth there is no readily applicable clinical test available. Hence, a molecular profiling assay is highly desired. It needs to be mentioned that current clinical definitions and recommendations for IUGR are unfortunately misleading and are not universally applicable. The most commonly adopted definition is an abdominal circumference (AC) or estimated fetal weight measurement <10th percentile. Although both, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG) agree that at this cut-off the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality increases, this definition does not take into account the individualized growth potential of each fetus. In particular its sole use fails to identify larger fetuses that have not achieved their growth potential and may be at risk of adverse outcomes. Also, this definition, when solely applied, will result in the misdiagnosis of IUGR for some constitutionally small fetuses. It needs to be pointed out that the above mentioned criteria can only be determined during pregnancy in case mothers report from early on during pregnancy. We have developed a test that relies on mass spectrometric analysis of the mother's serum protein composition (IUGR signature) which can be determined just ahead of delivery and at date of delivery, respectively using a minimal invasive blood sampling approach. With this manuscript we describe the use of a mass spectrometric profiling method of 30 peripheral blood samples from pregnant women prior to giving birth of either unsuspicious newborns or IUGR-affected infants. We report for the first time that maternal blood sample analysis via affinity mass spectrometry differentiates IUGR infants from controls with high confidence."
Does timing of pivotal clinical trial result reporting for newly approved medications varied by reporting source?,Pivotal trials of newly approved drugs appeared first in publications. Results from most pivotal trials were publicly available in some source within 30 days of approval.
Is sudden sensorineural hearing loss associated with chronic rhinosinusitis : population-based study?,"The adjusted odds ratio of having prior chronic rhinosinusitis among cases compared to controls was 1.36 (95 per cent confidence interval = 1.16-1.60). The significant relationship between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and chronic rhinosinusitis was most pronounced among those patients aged 44 years or less (compared to controls) (odds ratio = 2.18; 95 per cent confidence interval = 1.63-2.92). However, the significant relationship between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and prior chronic rhinosinusitis was not sustained for patients older than 60 years compared to controls."
Are practical one-dimensional measurements of age-related brain atrophy validated by 3-dimensional values and clinical outcomes : a retrospective study?,"Simple 1-D measurements of age-related brain atrophy are associated with 3-D values. Clinical validity of these methods is also supported by their association with post-injury ICH. Intracranial 3-D software is not available on many CT scanners and can be cumbersome, when available. Simple 1-D measurements, using the study methodology, are a practical method to objectify the presence of age-related brain atrophy."
Does apparent Diffusion Coefficient predict Pathology Complete Response of Rectal Cancer Treated with Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy?,"DWI-MRI technology can be efficient for predicting pCR for LARC after NCRT. Although the mean pre-CRT ADC value and the ΔADC% are moderate predictors for pCR, the latter would be more accurate."
Do the relationship between dental implant stability and trabecular bone structure using cone-beam computed tomography?,There was an increase in implant stability prediction by combining BV/TV and SMI in the stepwise forward regression analysis. Bone with high volume density and low surface density shows high implant stability. Well-connected thick bone with small marrow spaces also shows high implant stability. The combination of bone density and architectural parameters measured using CBCT can predict the implant stability more accurately than the density alone in clinical diagnoses.
Does protein malnutrition during pregnancy alter maternal behavior and anxiety-like behavior in offspring?,"In conclusion, the data found in our study suggest that the increase in USV emitted by pups due to hypoproteic diet during pregnancy accentuated maternal behavior. In addition, an increase in maternal care promoted the reduction in anxiety-like behavior in adult male offspring."
Does a Multichannel Medication Adherence Intervention influence Patient and Prescriber Behavior?,This study found increases in adherence to HTN and CHOL in 2 MA-PD plans implementing a combined prescriber and patient-directed intervention. MA-PD plans can use broad multichannel interventions to address common adherence barriers and as an approach to improving members' adherence to maintenance medications and CMS quality performance ratings.
Is language outcomes at 36 months in prematurely born children associated with the quality of developmental care in NICUs?,Findings suggest that higher quality of DC related to infant centered care can mitigate delays in language skills at 36 months in children born VPT.
Does aortic Root Aneurism Found in a 42-Year-Old epitomize the Importance of Auscultation in Routine Exams?,This case emphasizes the importance of periodic reassessment by thorough history and careful cardiac auscultation during flight physicals. BAV aortopathy is an uncommon condition seen in the military aviation community. Most flight surgeons will not have the opportunity to identify it specifically via auscultation. This patient had over nine annual flight physicals prior to the one reported and no pathology was ever identified through routine auscultation. The potential role of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for survey of vascular and valve status of aviation personnel merits further research.
Do molecular and cellular factors control signal transduction via switchable allosteric modulator proteins ( SAMPs )?,"We discuss data on Rap-Phr systems in B. subtilis to show how our models can contribute to an integrated view of SAMP signaling by combining biochemical, structural and physiological insights. Our results also suggest that SAMPs could be evolved or engineered to implement diverse response behaviors. However-without additional regulatory controls-they can generate rather variable cellular outputs."
Does lower alert rates by clustering of related drug interaction alert?,Using clusters of drug interaction alerts with similar management recommendations in CDSSs can substantially decrease the overall alert rate. Further research is needed to establish the applicability of this concept in daily practice.
Do peginterferon and Chinese herbs exert a combinatorial effect in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B?,The current evidence suggests that peginterferon plus Chinese herbal therapies were associated with higher virological response than peginterferon alone in HBeAg-positive CHB patients.
Is gut microbiota of Type 1 diabetes patients with good glycaemic control and high physical fitness similar to people without diabetes : an observational study?,We show that both gut microbiota and resulting functional bacterial profiles from patients with long-standing Type 1 diabetes in good glycaemic control and high physical fitness levels are comparable with those of matched people without diabetes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Does initial Conservative Management of Severe Hemispheric Stroke reduce Decompressive Craniectomy Rates?,"Delayed DC for hemispheric stroke patients managed under protocol in the neurocritical care unit is a safe alternative to early, prophylactic DC for adults with severe hemispheric stroke. This strategy reduced DC rates by 60 % without an excess of death or survival with severe disabilities."
Do normal Oral Keratinocytes and Head and Neck Squamous Carcinoma Cells Induce an Innate Response of Fibroblasts?,Keratinocytes have the capacity to induce an interleukin-1-dependent innate immune response by fibroblasts in vitro. This could be important for subsequent fibroblast modulation of the inflammatory reaction in non-malignant and malignant disease processes.
Are two standardized fractions of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis with rapid antidepressant effects differentially associated with BDNF up-regulation in the hippocampus?,"Two standardized fractions GJ-PE and GJ-BO exhibited comparable rapid antidepressant-like effects on the CMS mice. However, only the effects of GJ-PE was associated with BDNF signaling."
Does novel intragastric trocar placed by PEG technique permit endolumenal use of rigid instruments to simplify complex endoscopic procedures?,"The PIT device, deployed using the standard procedural steps of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, is safe and effective for use in the porcine model. PIT allows use of rigid instruments not previously available to the flexible endoscopist, including laparoscopic staplers, and potentially shortens procedure times for complex endoscopic techniques by allowing adjustable tissue traction."
Are cD28 and PTPN22 associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in Egyptians?,"Our results suggest that CD28(rs1980422) and PTPN22(rs2476601) contribute to RA-susceptibility in Egyptians. Failure to replicate the association of PADI4(rs2240340)/(PADI4_94) in Egyptian RA patients provides further support for the notion that genetic architecture of RA is different in multiple populations of European, Asian, African, and Middle Eastern ancestries. Further investigation using large-scale studies is thus needed to maximize the power of genetic association."
Does the Effectiveness of Percutaneous Vertebroplasty be Determined by the Patient-Specific Bone Condition and the Treatment Strategy?,We conclude that the effectiveness of vertebroplasty is sensitive to the patient's condition and the treatment strategy.
Is handgrip strength inversely and independently associated with multimorbidity among older women : Results from the KORA-Age study?,Lower levels of handgrip strength are associated with a higher odd of MMB among older women even after adjusting for traditional and novel confounders. Increasing the levels of muscular strength in older women seems to be important in order to reduce the risk for the co-occurrence of multiple chronic diseases.
Does bacterial superglue enable easy development of efficient virus-like particle based vaccines?,The spy-VLP system constitutes a versatile and rapid method to develop highly immunogenic VLP-based vaccines. Our data provide proof-of-concept for the technology's ability to present complex vaccine antigens to the immune system and elicit robust functional antibody responses as well as to efficiently break B cell self-tolerance. The spy-VLP-system may serve as a generic tool for the cost-effective development of effective VLP-vaccines against both infectious- and non-communicable diseases and could facilitate rapid and unbiased screening of vaccine candidate antigens.
Do aCUTE CHANGES IN PASSIVE GLENOHUMERAL ROTATION FOLLOWING TENNIS PLAY EXPOSURE IN ELITE FEMALE PLAYERS?,"Both GIR and TROM were reduced after acute exposure to tennis play. In a large subgroup of the cohort, the changes were clinically significant and approached values previously demonstrated to be associated with increased injury risk. Given the changes in glenohumeral motion following acute exposure to tennis, evaluation of players for significant motion alterations following overhead activity and intervention strategies to minimize such alterations in these players are recommended for high level tennis players."
Is the association between multimorbidity and hospitalization modified by individual demographics and physician continuity of care : a retrospective cohort study?,"The effect of multimorbidity on hospitalization is influenced by age and gender, important considerations in the development of person-centred care models. Greater continuity of physician care lessened the effect of multimorbidity on hospitalization, further demonstrating the need for care continuity across providers for people with chronic conditions."
Is neural activity during object perception in schizophrenia patients associated with illness duration and affective symptoms?,"Illness duration accounts for the weak activation of the middle occipital gyrus in patients during picture presentation. Affective symptoms, but not positive or negative symptoms, influence the activation of the right middle occipital gyrus and other brain areas."
Do cD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells play a central role in a HDM driven model of allergic asthma?,"This CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell dependent, HDM driven model of allergic asthma exhibits key features of asthma. Furthermore, we suggest that the ability to repeat challenge with HDM means this model is amenable to studies exploring the effect of therapeutic dosing in chronic, established disease."
Does comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Salivary Duct Carcinoma reveal Actionable Targets and Similarity to Apocrine Breast Cancer?,"This study illuminates the landscape of genetic alterations and gene expression programs in SDC, identifying numerous molecular targets and potential determinants of response to AR antagonism. This has relevance for emerging clinical studies of ADT and other targeted therapies in SDC. The similarities between SDC and apocrine breast cancer indicate that clinical data in breast cancer may generate useful hypotheses for SDC. Clin Cancer Res; 22(18); 4623-33. ©2016 AACR."
Is binding of Released Bim to Mcl-1 a Mechanism of Intrinsic Resistance to ABT-199 which can be Overcome by Combination with Daunorubicin or Cytarabine in AML Cells?,Our results demonstrate that sequestration of Bim by Mcl-1 is a mechanism of intrinsic ABT-199 resistance and supports the clinical development of ABT-199 in combination with cytarabine or daunorubicin for the treatment of AML. Clin Cancer Res; 22(17); 4440-51. ©2016 AACR.
Does embedded Instruction improve Vocabulary Learning During Automated Storybook Reading Among High-Risk Preschoolers?,The Story Friends curriculum appears to be highly feasible for delivery in early childhood educational settings and effective at teaching challenging vocabulary to high-risk preschoolers.
Does ultra-deep and quantitative saliva proteome reveal dynamics of the oral microbiome?,Rapid shotgun and robust technology can now simultaneously characterize the human and microbiome contributions to the proteome of a body fluid and is therefore a valuable complement to genomic studies. This opens new frontiers for the study of host-pathogen interactions and clinical saliva diagnostics.
Does intrahepatic angiogenesis increase portal hypertension in hepatitis B patients with cirrhosis?,Intrahepatic angiogenesis increases PH in hepatitis B patients with cirrhosis. The study provides the potential ways for therapeutic benefits in cirrhosis and PH.
Are low free triiodothyronine levels related to symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and poor functional outcomes after intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke patients?,"We found that lower free T3 levels are independently related to post-IVT sICH and poor functional outcomes at discharge in AIS patients with IVT, which should be verified and extended in large cohorts in the future."
Does high co-expression of PD-L1 and HIF-1α correlate with tumour necrosis in pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma?,High PD-L1 and HIF-1α co-expression was observed in PPCs compared with their expression in conventional non-small-cell lung carcinoma. The aggressive behaviour of PPC could be partially related to PD-L1-mediated immune escape and intratumoural hypoxia. High PD-L1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and may provide a rationale for the use of targeted immunotherapy in this subtype of high-grade PPC.
Does physical exercise during muscle regeneration improve recovery of the slow/oxidative phenotype?,"Exercise improved recovery of the slow/oxidative phenotype after soleus muscle injury. Muscle Nerve, 2016."
Is performance of robotic simulated skills tasks positively associated with clinical robotic surgical performance?,This is the first study to show a significant relationship between simulated robotic performance and robotic clinical performance. Findings support implementation of these robotic training tools in a standardized robotic training curriculum.
Does kinesiotaping enhance the rate of force development but not the neuromuscular efficiency of physically active young men?,"KT applied for muscle activation yielded a higher RFD during the initial phase of the muscle contraction. However, KT has no enhancement effect on NME and peak torque."

Is selective impairment of methylation maintenance the major cause of DNA methylation reprogramming in the early embryo?,"The main driver of DNA demethylation in germ cells and in the zygote is partial impairment of maintenance of symmetric DNA methylation at CpG dyads. In the embryo, this passive demethylation is restricted to the first cell division, whereas it continues over several cell divisions in germ cells. The dispersed patterns of CpG dyads in the early-cleavage embryo suggest a continuous partial (and to a low extent active) loss of methylation apparently compensated for by selective de novo methylation. We conclude that a combination of passive and active demethylation events counteracted by de novo methylation are involved in the distinct reprogramming dynamics of DNA methylomes in the zygote, the early embryo, and PGCs."

Does myoinhibitory peptide regulate feeding in the marine annelid Platynereis?,"Our results show that MIP activates ingestion and gut peristalsis in Platynereis postlarvae. MIP is expressed in enteroendocrine cells of the digestive system suggesting that following larval settlement, feeding may be initiated by a direct sensory-neurosecretory mechanism. This is similar to the mechanism by which MIP induces larval settlement. The pleiotropic roles of MIP may thus have evolved by redeploying the same signaling mechanism in different aspects of a life-cycle transition."

Previous reports on genomic profiling of BRCA1-mutated breast carcinomas have largely neglected this. Therefore, our findings have direct consequences on the interpretation of published genomic data. Also, these findings could prove valuable in light of currently used genomic tools for assessing BRCA1-involvement in breast cancer patients and pathogenicity assessment of BRCA1 variants of unknown significance. The BRCA1-associated genomic aberrations identified in this study provide possible leads to a better understanding of BRCA1-associated oncogenesis."
Does epigenetic balance of aberrant Rasal1 promoter methylation and hydroxymethylation regulate cardiac fibrosis?,"Our study provides proof-in-principle evidence that transcriptional suppression of RASAL1 through aberrant promoter methylation contributes to EndMT and ultimately to progression of cardiac fibrosis. Such aberrant methylation can be reversed through Tet3-mediated hydroxymethylation, which can be specifically induced by BMP7. This may reflect a new treatment strategy to stop cardiac fibrosis."
Is endoglin expression in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma associated with intravesical recurrence after radical nephroureterectomy?,"Endoglin is overexpressed in the endothelium of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas when compared with normal urothelium, and this overexpression seems to be associated with a higher risk of intravesical recurrence.

This MAD was associated with a higher titer of anti-V2 antibody responses, which was inversely correlated with peak and set-point viral loads. Unexpectedly, the pathogenic SIVmac239 challenge evaded the vaccine-elicited anti-V2 antibody response. Instead of recalling B-cell memory responses to the V2 MAD, viral infection directed anti-V1V2 antibodies primarily to V1 region. Moreover, the anti-V1V2 antibody responses diminished significantly in infected macaques after they enter the stage of simian AIDS. Our findings have critical implications to AIDS vaccine efforts with focus on V2 region."

Is laser in situ keratomileusis surgery safe for military personnel?,There is a high risk of potential traumatic flap problems after LASIK and it is not recommended in army service.
Do speech graphs provide a quantitative measure of thought disorder in psychosis?,"The results demonstrate that alterations of the thought process manifested in the speech of psychotic patients can be objectively measured using graph-theoretical tools, developed to capture specific features of the normal and dysfunctional flow of thought, such as divergence and recurrence. The quantitative analysis of speech graphs is not redundant with standard psychometric scales but rather complementary, as it yields a very accurate sorting of schizophrenics and manics. Overall, the results point to automated psychiatric diagnosis based not on what is said, but on how it is said."
Are abnormal vital signs strong predictors for intensive care unit admission and in-hospital mortality in adults triaged in the emergency department - a prospective cohort study?,"The HAPT system is valid in terms of predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU admission in the adult acute population. Abnormal vital signs are strongly associated with adverse outcome, while including the presenting complaint in the triage model may result in over-triage."

It therefore is a promising new exercise modality for individuals who are not able to participate in more strenuous exercise regimens.
Is aberrant localization of FUS and TDP43 associated with misfolding of SOD1 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?,We conclude that cytosolic mislocalization of FUS or TDP43 in vitro and ALS in vivo may kindle wtSOD1 misfolding in non-SOD1 FALS and SALS. The lack of immunohistochemical compartmental co-localization of misfolded SOD1 with cytosolic TDP43 or FUS suggests an indirect induction of SOD1 misfolding followed by propagation through template directed misfolding beyond its site of inception. The identification of a final common pathway in the molecular pathogenesis of ALS provides a treatment target for this devastating disease.

Axillary ultrasound should be used during primary systemic chemotherapy and before surgery.
Is laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy associated with significantly less overall morbidity compared to the open technique : a systematic review and meta-analysis?,"LDP has lower blood loss and reduced length of hospital stay. There was a lower risk of overall postoperative complications and wound infection, without a substantial increase in the operative time. Although a thorough evaluation of oncological outcomes was not possible, the rate of margin positivity was comparable to the open technique. The improved complication profile of LDP, taken together with the lack of compromise of margin status, suggests that this technique is a reasonable approach in selected cancer patients."
Does caffeine ingestion reverse the circadian rhythm effects on neuromuscular performance in highly resistance-trained men?,"These results indicate that caffeine ingestion reverses the morning neuromuscular declines in highly resistance-trained men, raising performance to the levels of the afternoon trial. Our electrical stimulation data, along with the NE values, suggest that caffeine increases neuromuscular performance having a direct effect in the muscle."
Are gH levels and insulin sensitivity differently associated with biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in active acromegaly?,"In patients with active acromegaly, GH excess contributes to the development of insulin resistance, and the interaction between both disturbances would be responsible for the appearance of atherogenic pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory factors. Insulin resistance would be preferably associated with an atherogenic lipoprotein profile and to high CETP activity, while high GH levels would independently predict the increase in LDL-C, ox-LDL and endothelin-1."
Are apolipoprotein epsilon 3 alleles associated with indicators of neuronal resilience?,"Our findings of neuronal and glial events, which correlate with lesser neuronal DNA damage and larger, more robust neurons in epilepsy patients of APOE ε3,3 genotype compared to APOE ε4,4 genotype carriers, are consistent with the idea that the APOE ε3,3 genotype better protects neurons subjected to the hyperexcitability of epilepsy and thus confers less risk of AD (Alzheimer's disease).Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/10/36."
Do sMAD4 genetic alterations predict a worse prognosis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma?,"Most SMAD4 mutations are located in the mutational hotspot, mutation cluster region, present within MH2 domain. SMAD4 mutations affect Smad4 protein expression to different extents, depending on their location within the gene. SMAD4 gene alterations predict a worse outcome for patients with PDAC."
Does exome sequencing of prostate cancer support the hypothesis of independent tumour origins?,"No high-frequency mutations, common for the three tumour samples of SWE-1, were identified. Ten randomly chosen positions were validated with Sanger sequencing in all foci, which verified the exome data. The high level of intraprostatic heterogeneity was consistent in all individuals. In total, three out of four individuals harboured tumours without an apparent common somatic denominator. Although we cannot exclude the presence of common structural rearrangements, a high-density array was used for the detection of deletions and amplifications in SWE-1, which agreed with the exome data."

Moreover, our study concerned only the central dimension (awareness of mental disorder) of 1 scale (SUMD); other dimensions of insight could be studied."
Are smaller hippocampal volumes in patients with bipolar disorder masked by exposure to lithium : a meta-analysis?,Missing information about the illness burden or lifetime exposure to Li and polypharmacy in some studies may have contributed to statistical heterogeneity in some analyses.
Is anxiety disorder associated with nocturnal and early morning hypertension with or without morning surge : ambulatory blood pressure monitoring?,"Anxiety disorder is associated with nocturnal and early morning hypertension, and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular events."
Are nitrile hydratase genes present in multiple eukaryotic supergroups?,"The evidence presented here demonstrates that nitrile hydratase genes are present in multiple eukaryotic supergroups, suggesting that a subunit fusion gene was present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes. The absence of nitrile hydratase from several sequenced species indicates that subunits were lost in multiple eukaryotic taxa. The presence of nitrile hydratases in many other eukaryotic groups is unresolved due to insufficient data and taxon sampling. The retention and expression of the gene in distantly related eukaryotic species suggests that it plays an important metabolic role. The novel family of eukaryotic nitrile hydratases presented in this paper represents a promising candidate for research into their molecular biology and possible biotechnological applications."
Are human fetal testis xenografts resistant to phthalate-induced endocrine disruption?,Phthalate exposure of grafted human fetal testis altered fetal germ cells but did not reduce expression of genes that regulate fetal testosterone biosynthesis.
Do histopathologic response criteria predict survival of patients with resected lung cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy?,"The percentages of residual viable tumor cells predict OS and DFS in patients with resected NSCLC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy even when controlled for pathologic stage. Histopathologic assessment of resected specimens after neoadjuvant chemotherapy could potentially have a role in addition to pathologic stage in assessing prognosis, chemotherapy response, and the need for additional adjuvant therapies."

Does cyclical etidronate plus ergocalciferol prevent glucocorticoid-induced bone loss in postmenopausal women?,"Chronic glucocorticoid therapy may result in bone loss at most skeletal sites. Therapy with cyclical etidronate plus ergocalciferol not only prevented glucocorticoid-induced bone loss, but even increased lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD in postmenopausal women commencing glucocorticoid therapy."
Do angina-linked syncope and lack of calcium antagonist therapy predict cardiac arrest before definitive diagnosis of vasospastic angina?,"From the clinical findings available, a history of angina-linked syncope and lack of calcium antagonist therapy were found to be independent predictors of cardiac arrest before a definitive diagnosis had been made. Patients who have suspected vasospastic angina may benefit from early treatment with calcium antagonists if they have a history of angina-linked syncope."
Does replacement of dehydroepiandrosterone enhance T-lymphocyte insulin binding in postmenopausal women?,Fifty milligrams per day of oral DHEA gives suprahysiologic androgen levels; 25 mg/d may be more appropriate. Dehydroepiandrosterone enhanced tissue insulin sensitivity and lowered serum triglycerides. Rationale is provided for postmenopausal replacement therapy with this androgen.
Does disruption of conserved rhodopsin disulfide bond by Cys187Tyr mutation cause early and severe autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa?,"An early onset, blinding form of autosomal dominant RP results from a rhodopsin Cys187Tyr mutation that eliminates a residue necessary for the formation of a highly conserved disulfide bond essential to normal rhodopsin function. The fact that one family member is significantly less affected than his younger relatives suggests that genetic or environmental factors can modulate the phenotype."
Do clinical factors predict surgical outcomes in pediatric MRI-negative drug-resistant epilepsy?,"Surgical outcomes in children with MRI-negative DRE are determined by clinical factors including seizure frequency, age of onset of seizures, and number of failed AEDs."
Are epigenetic reprogramming and aberrant expression of PRAME associated with increased metastatic risk in Class 1 and Class 2 uveal melanomas?,"PRAME is aberrantly hypomethylated and activated in Class 1 and Class 2 uveal melanomas and is associated with increased metastatic risk in both classes. Since PRAME has been successfully targeted for immunotherapy, it may prove to be a companion prognostic biomarker."
Does para-Dichlorobenzene Exposure be Associated with Thyroid Dysfunction in US Adolescents?,"This study demonstrates a potential relationship between para-dichlorobenzene exposure, measured as urinary 2,5-DCP, and thyroid dysfunction in adolescents; however, further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to elucidate mechanisms of action."

Does a recombinant TGF-β1 vaccine ameliorate diabetic nephropathy in OLETF rats?,"TGF-β1 vaccine attenuated diabetic nephropathy in OLETF rats through reduction of inflammation, improvement of kidney fibrosis and partial correction of glucose metabolism."
Are statins a risk factor for liver damage associated with intravenous glucocorticoid pulse therapy for Graves ' orbitopathy?,"The lack of observation of cases of ALD in patients given ivGC and statins is quite reassuring. Although caution should be applied to any patient candidate to ivGC treatment and this should be particularly accurate in patients given statins, our findings somehow justify the use of ivGC in patients under statins, although further studies in larger cohorts are needed to confirm our conclusions."
Does canakinumab reverse overexpression of inflammatory response genes in tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome?,"These gene expression data support a model in which canakinumab produces clinical benefit in TRAPS by increasing neutrophil apoptosis and reducing pro-inflammatory signals resulting from the inhibition of IL-1β. Notably, treatment normalised the overexpression of TNFRSF1A, suggesting that canakinumab has a direct impact on the main pathogenic mechanism in TRAPS."
Does inactivation of the LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway contribute to salivary gland tumor development - a short report?,"In contrast to many other types of cancer, inactivation or downregulation of the LKB1/AMPK pathway does not substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of salivary gland tumors."
Do pTEN alterations of the stromal cells characterise an aggressive subpopulation of pancreatic cancer with enhanced metastatic potential?,"We find various mechanisms of PTEN protein loss in the different tumour cell populations, including allelic PTEN deletions, gross chromosomal 10 aberrations and altered miR-21 expression. PTEN deletion is a major cause of PTEN protein loss in PDAC and correlates with aggressive characteristics and worse outcome. PTEN protein loss in juxta-tumoural stromal cells is mostly due to PTEN haplo-insufficiency and characterises a subgroup of PDACs with enhanced metastatic potential. In the tumour microenvironment of the invasive front, PTEN silencing by miR-21 in cancer and surrounding stromal cells acts not only cooperatively but also independently of the genetic aberrations to precipitate PTEN protein loss and promote further tumour growth."
Do the Clinical Predictors That Facilitate a Clinician 's Decision to Order Genetic Testing for Rett Syndrome?,"Loss of hand skills resulted in the highest odds of having a positive genetic test. Gait abnormalities and stereotypic hand movements were also strong predictors of MECP2+ testing. Many individuals with language delay had genetic testing; however, this is the least specific of the major criteria. These findings have implications for which patients should have genetic testing."
Does microRNA 433 regulate nonsense-mediated mRNA decay by targeting SMG5 mRNA?,"Our study highlights that miR-433 represses nonsense mediated mRNA decay. The miR-433 targets 3'-UTR of SMG5 and represses the expression of SMG5, whereas NMD activity is decreased when SMG5 is decreased. This discovery provides evidence for microRNA/NMD regulatory mechanism."

Is rate of perihaematomal oedema expansion associated with poor clinical outcomes in intracerebral haemorrhage?,Rate of PHE growth over 72 hours was an independent predictor of mortality and poor functional outcomes following ICH. Baseline haematoma volume and gender appear to influence PHE growth.
Does the Moses-Littenberg meta-analytical method generate systematic differences in test accuracy compared to hierarchical meta-analytical models?,"Moses-Littenberg meta-analyses can generate lower estimates of test accuracy, and smaller differences in accuracy, compared to mathematically superior hierarchical models. This has implications for the usefulness of meta-analyses using this approach. We recommend meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies to be conducted using available hierarchical model-based approaches."
Does early Cumulative Supplemental Oxygen predict Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in High Risk Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns?,"In high-risk extremely low gestational age newborns, the predictive accuracy of CSO plateaus at 14 days. CSO is independently associated with BPD or death. This index may identify infants who could benefit from early intervention to prevent BPD."
Does swimming exercise attenuate psychological dependence and voluntary methamphetamine consumption in methamphetamine withdrawn rats?,"This study showed that regular swimming exercise reduced voluntary METH consumption in animal models of craving by reducing anxiety, OCD, and depression in the METH-withdrawn rats. Thus, physical training may be ameliorating some of the withdrawal behavioral consequences of METH."

Does novel GUCY2D mutation cause phenotypic variability of Leber congenital amaurosis in a large kindred?,"This is the first documentation of the p.Ala710Val mutation in GC1 and the second ever described mutation in its protein kinase domain. Our findings enlarge the scope of genetic variability of LCA, highlight the phenotypic heterogeneity found amongst individuals harboring an identical LCA mutation, and possibly provide hope for gene therapy in patients with this congenital blinding disease. As the Bedouin kindred studied originates from Saudi Arabia, the mutation found might be an ancient founder mutation in that large community."
Does magnetic resonance imaging facilitate breast conservation for occult breast cancer?,MRI of the breast can identify occult breast cancer in many patients and may facilitate breast conservation in select women. Negative breast MRI predicts low tumor yield at mastectomy.
Does lumbar support for prevention and treatment of low back pain?,There is still a need for high quality randomised trials on the effectiveness of lumbar supports. One of the most essential issues to tackle in these future trials seems to be the realisation of an adequate compliance.

"Are adjacent genes , for COL2A1 and the vitamin D receptor , associated with separate features of radiographic osteoarthritis of the knee?","Our findings demonstrate that both the COL2A1 gene and the VDR gene are involved in ROA, but in separate features. The COL2A1 genotype is associated with JSN, while the VDR genotype is associated with osteophytes."
Do umbilical artery Doppler studies in small for gestational age babies reflect disease severity?,Abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies reflect earlier onset and more severe growth restriction and are not independently associated with newborn morbidity. Small for gestational age babies with normal Doppler studies have a high rate of newborn nursery admission and malnutrition at birth and are not all just normal small babies.
Do parameters of suicidal crises vary as a function of previous suicide attempts in youth inpatients?,Previous suicidal experience may alter the parameters of current suicidal crises. Implications of these findings for suicide risk and clinical assessment and management are discussed.
Is age the major determinant of recurrence in pediatric differentiated thyroid carcinoma?,Age is the major determinant of recurrence in pediatric differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The results suggest different tumor biology in young children requiring novel approaches to therapy to decrease recurrence rates.
Does a comparison of suburban and urban daytime telephone triage call?,"Calls received by a daytime nurse telephone triage office in an affluent SP and a UP are similar in regard to medical problems. Training programs can feasibly prepare physicians and nurses for both kinds of practice settings. The urban site received more calls affected by language and social issues. This could have administrative implications for staffing ratios, language skills of staff and knowledge of available support services."

Does dexamethasone reduce the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass in children?,Dexamethasone administration prior to CPB in children leads to a reduction in the postbypass inflammatory response as assessed by cytokine levels and clinical course.
Do surgery and intensive care procedures affect the target site distribution of piperacillin?,"During the postoperative and intensive care periods, target site concentrations of piperacillin are markedly altered and decreased. This may also be true for other antibiotic agents and may have clinical implications in that current dosing guidelines may result in inadequate target site concentrations for high-MIC strains. Conceivably, this could lead to therapeutic failure in some patients."
"Is the Helicobacter pylori vacA s1 , m1 genotype and cagA associated with gastric carcinoma in Germany?","Our study suggests a significant association between the H. pylori vacA s1,m1 genotype, cytotoxic activity, cagA, and gastric cancer. Detection of H. pylori possessing these virulence determinants may help to identify patients being at an increased risk to develop gastric cancer in our population."
Is manometry of the upper esophageal sphincter and pharynx useful in unselected patients referred for esophageal testing?,"An unexpected UES/P finding resulted in a change in therapy in only six of the manometries. Barium esophagogram was diagnostic of the oropharyngeal abnormality in nearly two-thirds of the patients in whom it was clinically suspected. These data, along with limited therapeutic options, suggest limited usefulness for routine UES/P manometry."
Do the time course of high-frequency bands ( 15-45 Hz ) in all-night spectral analysis of sleep EEG?,"Our study shows a new method for the analysis of high frequencies (up to 45 Hz) in the scalp-recorded sleep EEG which allowed us to better define, as compared to previous studies on the same topic, the changes in power characteristically associated with REM sleep and correlated with the REM/non-REM ultradian rhythm, and to propose it as a tool for future studies."
Is depression a risk factor for noncompliance with medical treatment : meta-analysis of the effects of anxiety and depression on patient adherence?,"Compared with nondepressed patients, the odds are 3 times greater that depressed patients will be noncompliant with medical treatment recommendations. Recommendations for future research include attention to causal inferences and exploration of mechanisms to explain the effects. Evidence of strong covariation of depression and medical noncompliance suggests the importance of recognizing depression as a risk factor for poor outcomes among patients who might not be adhering to medical advice."
Does deadspace to tidal volume ratio predict successful extubation in infants and children?,"A V(D)/V(T) < or =0.50 reliably predicts successful extubation, whereas a V(D)/V(T) >0.65 identifies patients at risk for respiratory failure following extubation. There appears to be an intermediate V(D)/V(T) range (0.51-0.65) that is less predictive of successful extubation. Routine V(D)/V(T) monitoring of pediatric patients may permit earlier extubation and reduce unexpected extubation failures."
Is reduction of benzodiazepine receptor binding related to the seizure onset zone in extratemporal focal cortical dysplasia?,Flumazenil-PET is a useful tool for localization of the epileptogenic zone in patients with extratemporal epilepsy caused by focal cortical dysplasia. Neuronal distribution of BDZ-receptor density confirms in vivo flumazenil-PET findings. The regional reduction of BDZ-receptor binding in focal cortical dysplasia seems to be confined to the seizure onset zone and not to the extent of dysplastic cortex.
Does coping skills training for youth with diabetes mellitus have long-lasting effects on metabolic control and quality of life?,The addition of behavioral intervention to IDM in adolescence results in improved metabolic control and quality of life over 1 year.
Do standardized burn model using a multiparametric histologic analysis of burn depth?,The authors describe a simple and reproducible animal burn model and histopathologic scale for measuring burn depth that they believe will facilitate standardization and comparison within future burn studies.
Is secretion of inhibin B during ovarian stimulation decreased in infertile women with endometriosis?,Decreased inhibin B secretion in patients with endometriosis suggests impaired granulosa cell function. Inhibin B may serve as an alternate marker to assess follicular development or to predict the number of oocytes retrieved.
Is brain function rescue effect of lactate following hypoglycaemia an adaptation process in both normal and type I diabetic subjects?,A blood lactate increase after the development of hypoglycaemic symptoms reduces counterregulatory and symptomatic responses to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and favours brain function rescue both in normal and diabetic subjects. These findings confirm that lactate is an alternative substrate to glucose for cerebral metabolism under hypoglycaemic conditions.
Are increasing supplies of dermatologists and family physicians associated with earlier stage of melanoma detection?,"Increasing supplies of dermatologists and family physicians were associated with earlier detection of melanoma. In contrast, increasing supplies of general internists were associated with reduced odds of early detection. Our findings suggest that the composition of the physician work force may affect important health outcomes and needs further study."
Do pregnancy rates after embryo transfer depend on the provider at embryo transfer?,"Significant differences were observed in pregnancy rates after embryo transfer done by different providers, suggesting that embryo transfer technique may influence pregnancy outcome in assisted reproductive technology."
Is deletion of a 5-cM region at chromosome 8p23 associated with a spectrum of congenital heart defects?,Haploinsufficiency for a gene between WI-8327 and D8S1825 is critical for heart development. A causal relationship does not seem to exist between GATA4 and ANGPT2 haploinsufficiency and CHDs.
Does multi-variate analysis predict clinical outcome 30 days after middle cerebral artery infarction?,"Our work demonstrates that a good clinical outcome at day 30 depends on a good initial clinical score at day 1, a small volume of infarction, a small decrease of NAA/Cho, and being of the female gender."
Is the auditory event-related potential a stable and reliable measure in elderly subjects over a 3 year period?,Robust within-subject reliability of the ERP strengthens its potential use for detecting preclinical changes in at-risk elderly populations.
Do ovariectomy and 17beta-estradiol modulate the levels of Alzheimer 's amyloid beta peptides in brain?,"Our results infer that cessation of ovarian estrogen production in postmenopausal women might facilitate Abeta deposition by increasing the local concentrations of Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides in brain. In addition, our finding that E2 treatment is associated with diminution of brain Abeta levels suggests that modulation of Abeta metabolism may be one of the ways by which estrogen replacement therapy prevents or delays the onset of AD or both in postmenopausal women."
Is the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene found in Chinese haemochromatotic patients : multicentre retrospective study?,"The classical form of human leukocyte antigen-linked hereditary haemochromatosis appears to be absent form this locality. The H63D mutation is found in a minority (9.8%) of the patients, in whom it may act synergistically with an erythropoietic factor."
"Is tmp21-I , a vesicular trafficking protein , differentially expressed during induction of the ureter and metanephros?","Tmp21-I is a developmentally regulated gene expressed during kidney induction. Localized within the nephrogenic zone, it may direct the intracellular trafficking or secretion of proteins responsible for nephrogenesis."
Is a CRX null mutation associated with both Leber congenital amaurosis and a normal ocular phenotype?,These results strongly suggest that haploinsufficiency of CRX is not sufficient to cause a retinal disorder. Loss of function alleles of CRX appear to cause Leber congenital amaurosis through a recessive or multigenic mechanism.
Does automated registration of frontal and lateral radionuclide lung scan with digital chest radiographs?,"The automated method for the registration of radionuclide lung scans with digital chest radiographs to produce images that combine functional and structural information should benefit nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists, who must visually correlate images that differ greatly in physical size, resolution properties, and information content."
Is lack of interleukin-6 expression protective against focal central nervous system ischemia?,"In this study, infarct size and neurological function at 24 hours were not different in animals deficient in IL-6 after transient CNS ischemia. This suggests that IL-6 does not have a direct influence on acute ischemic injury. Further study investigating the role of IL-6 on long-term recovery after stroke is in progress."
Is elevation of only one rheumatoid factor isotype associated with increased prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis -- a population based study?,"In contrast to a combined elevation of IgM and IgA RF, elevation of only one RF isotype may not be a significant risk factor for the development of RA."
Are surrogate markers of intestinal inflammation predictive of relapse in patients with inflammatory bowel disease?,"Fecal calprotectin predicts clinical relapse of disease activity in patients with CD and UC, whereas small intestinal permeability is a useful predictor of relapse in patients with small intestinal CD."
Does normalization of hematocrit in hemodialysis patients with cardiac disease increase blood pressure?,It is possible to increase hematocrit to normal levels in hemodialysis with the administration of Epoetin alfa. The increase in hematocrit from 30+/-3% to 42+/-3% is not associated with increased blood pressure.
Is selective use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation warranted after lung transplantation?,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation provides effective therapy for acute post-transplantation lung dysfunction. The frequency and pattern of our extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use reflects bias toward early extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for isolated graft failure in otherwise intact and uninfected recipients.
Do serial blood lactate measurements predict early outcome after neonatal repair or palliation for complex congenital heart disease?,Serial blood lactate level measurements may be an accurate predictor of death or the requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support for patients who undergo complex neonatal cardiac surgery.
Does angiographic and scintigraphic ( perfusion and electrocardiogram-gated SPECT ) correlate of clinical presentation in unstable angina?,"The highest levels of the Braunwald classification are associated with a greater size and intensity of myocardial perfusion and wall motion abnormalities and with the angiographic findings of complex morphology, intracoronary thrombus, and decreased TIMI flow."
"Is memory impairment in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors associated with global reduction in brain volume , not focal hippocampal injury?","Memory impairment in OHCA survivors is associated with global cerebral atrophy, not selective hippocampal damage. Rehabilitation protocols need to account for the global nature of the brain injury."

Do schizophrenic subjects show aberrant fMRI activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia during working memory performance?,Aberrant WM performance and brain activation in schizophrenia may reflect dysfunction of frontostriatal circuitry that subserves WM. Future studies will elucidate the contribution of the anatomical components of this circuitry to WM deficits.
Do omega-3 fatty acids decrease endothelial adhesion of human colorectal carcinoma cells?,These data indicate that omega-3 fatty acids may also be protective against the formation of hepatic metastases. The mechanism for this may be decreased endothelial cell adhesion which in turn may be due to decreased expression of the endothelial receptor sialyl-Lewis(x).
Do the fetal and childhood growth of persons who develop type 2 diabetes?,These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that type 2 diabetes is programmed in utero in association with low rates of fetal growth. The increased risk for type 2 diabetes associated with small size at birth is further increased by high growth rates after 7 years of age.
Is cardioprotective mechanism of ischemic preconditioning impaired by postinfarct ventricular remodeling through angiotensin II type 1 receptor activation?,"The myocardium remodeled after infarction is refractory to PC, which is probably due to interruption of cellular signaling by PC upstream of mitoK(ATP) channels. An AT(1) receptor blocker is beneficial not only for suppression of ventricular remodeling but also for preservation of the PC mechanism."
Do effects of dynamic range and amplitude mapping on phoneme recognition in Nucleus-22 cochlear implant users?,"Phoneme recognition with a 4-channel CIS strategy was only mildly affected by large changes in both electric threshold and loudness mapping. Errors in threshold by a factor of 2 (6 dB) and in the loudness mapping exponent by a factor of 2 were required to produce a significant decrease in performance. In these extreme conditions, the effect of the electric dynamic range on phoneme recognition could be due to two independent factors: abnormal loudness growth and a reduction in the number of discriminable intensity steps. The decrease in performance caused by a reduced electric dynamic range can be compensated by a more expansive power-law mapping function, as long as the number of discriminable intensity steps is moderately large (e.g., >8)."
Does diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging identify the `` clinically relevant '' small-penetrator infarcts?,T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR imaging fail to identify the clinically relevant SPI in almost one quarter of the patients found to have a lesion on DWI. The characteristics of DWI make it well suited for the detection of acute small infarcts. Diffusion-weighted imaging is necessary to consistently define the clinical-anatomical relations in patients initially seen with SPIs.
Do determinants of bone and blood lead concentrations in the early postpartum period?,"This study identified the use of lead glazed ceramics as a major source of cumulative exposure to lead, as reflected by bone lead concentrations, as well as current exposure, reflected by blood lead, in Mexico. A higher proportion of life spent in Mexico City, a proxy for exposure to leaded gasoline emissions, was identified as the other major source of cumulative lead exposure. The influence of bone lead on blood lead coupled with the long half life of lead in bone has implications for other populations and suggests that bone stores may pose a threat to women of reproductive age long after exposure has declined."
Do childhood depressive symptoms predict psychiatric problems in young adults?,"Depressive symptoms in children should be addressed to prevent later psychiatric problems. The CDI may be a measure of nonspecific psychopathology rather than of pure depression--thus, it may be a good screening tool for child populations."
Does a binary complex of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and adenosine further define conformational flexibility?,"The binary complex of rC and adenosine adopts an 'intermediate' conformation relative to the previously described 'closed' and 'open' conformations of other rC complexes. Based on a comparison of these structures, the induced fit that is necessary for catalysis and closing of the active-site cleft appears to be confined to the small lobe, as in the absence of the peptide the conformation of the large lobe, including the peptide-docking surface, does not change. Three specific components contribute to the closing of the cleft: rotation of the small lobe; movement of the C-terminal tail; and closing of the so-called glycine-rich loop. There is no induced fit in the large lobe to accommodate the peptide and the closing of the cleft. A portion of the C-terminal tail, residues 315-334, serves as a gate for the entry or exit of the nucleotide into the hydrophobic active-site cleft."
Is neurocognitive impairment in human immunodeficiency virus infection correlated with sexually transmitted disease history?,Sexually transmitted diseases in HIV-infected subjects are correlated with neurocognitive impairment through an unidentified mechanism.
"Is aCE inhibitor use associated with hospitalization for severe hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes . DARTS/MEMO Collaboration . Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside , Scotland . Medicines Monitoring Unit?","The results show that the association between ACE inhibitor therapy and hospital admission for severe hypoglycemia is not explained by these confounding factors. Although ACE inhibitors have distinct advantages over other antihypertensive drugs in diabetes, the risk of hypoglycemia should be considered."
Do serum neuron-specific enolase levels increase after electroconvulsive therapy?,"ECT did not increase serum NSE values, indicating that electroconvulsive therapy does not cause neuronal damage."
Is mucosal interleukin-8 involved in neutrophil migration and binding to extracellular matrix in inflammatory bowel disease?,"Increased mucosal generation of IL-8 may attract neutrophils from the circulation into the inflammatory site and induce binding of neutrophils in the interstitial tissue, contributing to accumulation and activation of neutrophils in the affected mucosa with IBD."
Is the C-X-C chemokine ENA-78 preferentially expressed in intestinal epithelium in inflammatory bowel disease?,The observations are in agreement with a role of the C-X-C chemokine ENA-78 in the pathogenesis of IBD.
Is human papillomavirus type in anal epithelial lesions influenced by human immunodeficiency virus?,The presence of high-risk HPV types and multiple types within low-grade lesions may explain the increased risk of neoplastic progression in HIV patients. Colocalization of HIV and HPV does not appear to be required for this effect. There is no evidence that HPV integration is influenced by HIV infection.
Do distal hyperplastic polyps predict proximal adenomas : results from a multicentric study of colorectal adenomas?,Our data show that the presence of hyperplastic polyps should not be the sole indication for total colonoscopy because they are not associated with proximal adenomas when adjusting for patient characteristics and presence of distal adenomas.
Is high-resolution endoluminal sonography a sensitive modality for the identification of Barrett 's metaplasia?,"HRES is a sensitive new method for identifying Barrett's esophagus. However, dysplasia could not be identified by HRES in this study."
Does colchicine reduce hepatic fibrosis in mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum?,"These findings suggest that colchicine has therapeutic effect on schistosomal liver fibrosis, through not only killing off the schistosome but interfering the metabolism of collagen."
Is the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein gene associated with Crohn 's disease?,This study is the first to report an association between the NRAMP gene and Crohn's disease.
Does active immunization using dendritic cells mixed with tumor cells inhibit the growth of primary breast cancer?,These results suggest that DCs mixed with tumor cells as a source of undefined tumor antigen can induce an effective antitumor immune response. This finding provides a rationale for the use of cultured DCs in immunotherapy of breast and other cancers.
Are dietetics and foodservice personnel ready for team problem solving?,"The results of this study generate optimism for involving all dietetics and foodservice personnel in team problem solving. However, training activities are needed for both foodservice personnel and dietetics professionals."
Are fat-gram counting and food-record rating equally effective for evaluating food records in reduced-fat diets?,Fat-gram counting is at least as effective as food-record rating in monitoring dietary fat content. Dietitians can use it as an alternative dietary fat-monitoring procedure for clinical practice and research.
Does thromboxane A2-receptor blockade improve cerebral protection for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest?,Thromboxane A2 mediates impairments in cerebral perfusion and metabolism following deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. These changes were attenuated by blockade of thromboxane A2-receptors using vapiprost. Endothelins are not shown to be involved. Better knowledge of injury mechanisms will enable development of more effective cerebral protection strategies and allow safer application of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
Does activation of the CD95 system increase with disease progression in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children and adolescents?,Disturbed regulation of the CD95 system may play an important role in the development of immunodeficiency during the course of HIV infection in children.
Is heart rate variability in patients with atrial fibrillation related to vagal tone?,This study shows that HRV in patients with atrial fibrillation is related to vagal tone.
Is planimetry of aortic valve area using multiplane transoesophageal echocardiography a reliable method for assessing severity of aortic stenosis?,Planimetry of aortic valve area by TOE is difficult and less accurate than the continuity equation for assessing the severity of aortic stenosis.
Does circumstances of fall resulting in hip fractures among older people?,Strategies aimed at preventing fall-related hip fractures among the old old and among institutionalized individuals should focus primarily on the modification of intrinsic factors. Modification of environmental hazards has the greatest potential for prevention among the young old and those living in private homes.
Does lossy ( 15:1 ) JPEG compression of digital coronary angiograms limit detection of subtle morphological features?,"The identification of dissections, thrombi, and coronary stents is not substantially impaired by the application of 15:1 lossy JPEG compression to digital coronary angiograms. These data suggest that digital angiographic images compressed in this manner are acceptable for clinical decision-making."
Is intraoperative echocardiography indicated in high-risk coronary artery bypass grafting?,"We conclude that when all of the isolated diagnostic and monitoring applications of perioperative echocardiography are routinely and systematically performed together, it is a safe and viable tool that significantly affects the decision-making process in the intraoperative care of high-risk patients undergoing primary isolated coronary artery bypass grafting and may contribute to the optimal care of these patients."
Do [ Early and long-term results of rehabilitation of cochlear implant patients ] ]?,"In adults, open set speech understanding can be achieved even at the first tune-up. Results of early rehabilitation seem to be influenced by duration and etiology of deafness, experience with hearing aids, and other factors."
Is radiologic emphysema morphology associated with outcome after surgical lung volume reduction?,"The morphologic type of emphysema, assessed by a simplified surgically oriented classification, is an important predictor of surgical outcome. Lung volume reduction surgery may also improve dyspnea and lung function in homogeneous emphysema."
Is olfactory dysfunction in allergic rhinitis related to nasal eosinophilic inflammation?,Patients with grass pollen allergy develop olfactory dysfunction during natural allergen exposure that might be related to allergic inflammatory mechanisms.
Does microvessel count predict metastasis and prognosis in patients with gastric cancer?,Microvessel count correlated well with tumor progression and may serve as a useful prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer.
Does pediatric cervical spine injury sustained in fall from low heights?,All children in this study with the diagnosis of cervical spine injury had clinical evidence of that injury on history or physical examination. Clinicians treating asymptomatic young children who sustain short falls may not need to perform radiographic evaluation of the cervical spine.
Is dehydroepiandrosterone treatment beneficial to the immune response to influenza in elderly subjects?,"Although highly effective in aged rodents, a short course of DHEA treatment did not improve the age-related declined response to immunization against influenza in human subjects. Higher baseline DHEA-S levels are not predictive of better immunization against influenza in the elderly."
Does prolonged surgery increase the likelihood of admission of scheduled ambulatory surgery patients?,Surgery duration of 60 minutes or longer was the most important predictor of unanticipated admission following scheduled ambulatory surgery.
Are anterior horn cells also involved in Japanese encephalitis?,Varying degree of anterior horn cell involvement seems to be common in JE.
Do an integrated graphic data display improves detection and identification of critical events during anesthesia?,"The results show that some simulated critical events are detected and correctly identified sooner, when an anesthesiologist views an integrated graphic display, rather than a traditional digital/waveform monitor."
Do local interactions in a Schellman motif dictate interhelical arrangement in a protein fragment?,"The presence of a Schellman motif in this isolated fragment in water is governed by local interactions and specifies the interspatial arrangement of the helices. This observation underlines the structure predictive value of folding motifs. As proposed for a Schellman motif, helix termination in this fragment is dictated by the local distribution of polar/apolar residues, which is reminiscent of the binary code for protein folding."
Does frequency and correlate of severe hypoglycaemia in children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus?,In this study severe hypoglycaemia was more frequent in young children than in adolescents and was independent of metabolic control and insulin dose.
Does a randomized trial of a consultation service to reduce fall in nursing homes?,"The high rate of falls and related injuries in nursing homes should not be viewed as inevitable, but as outcomes that can be substantially improved through structured safety programs."
Does circumstances and consequences of fall in independent community-dwelling older adults?,"the results of this study provide insight into the circumstances and consequences of falls among independent community-dwelling older adults and suggest some possible ways of preventing falls. Preventive services, however, should not solely target recurrent fallers, nor should the type of services necessarily differ for one-time and recurrent fallers."
Are elevated concentrations of cardiac troponins associated with severe coronary artery calcification in asymptomatic haemodialysis patients?,"Elevated concentrations of cTnT and cTnI, but not BNP or CK-MB, were independently associated with the degree of severity of CAC in asymptomatic haemodialysis patients."
Does child temperament predict adolescent body composition in girls?,"Although high activity temperament was associated cross-sectionally with lower percentage body fat and higher NREE, we did not find evidence to support our hypothesis that high child activity temperament would be protective for increased adiposity prospectively in our cohort of girls followed over the adolescent period."
Does analysis of text from injury reports improve understanding of construction falls?,"The significant contribution of motor vehicles and heavy equipment to FFH, particularly those preceded by slips/trips, was not apparent from coded data. Heavy equipment engineering modifications are called for and workers in street/roadway construction/site development need fall protection training. Text analyses allow exploration of factors not identified at the time of data collection and better understanding of the context in which injuries occur."
Does reduction of treatment frequency and UVA dose substantially compromise the antipsoriatic effect of oral psoralen-UVA?,Reducing treatment frequency and UVA dose does not substantially compromise the therapeutic efficacy of PUVA.
Is macrophage liver X receptor required for antiatherogenic activity of LXR agonists?,These data substantiate that drugs targeting macrophage LXR activity may offer therapeutic benefit in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Does catechol-O-methyltransferase val108/158met genotype predict working memory response to antipsychotic medications?,These results support other data suggesting that the COMT val(108/158)met polymorphism might be an important factor in the cognitive response to antipsychotic medication.
Is release of neurobiochemical markers of brain damage related to the neurovascular status on admission and the site of arterial occlusion in acute ischemic stroke?,"Protein S100B may serve as a monitoring parameter in acute ischemic stroke, especially with respect to the neurovascular status. Furthermore, S100B obtains additional information about functional outcome."
Does late-onset Pompe disease primarily affect quality of life in physical health domains?,"Patients with late-onset Pompe disease are, on average, markedly affected on the physical health domains of quality of life, but score only slightly lower than the general population on the mental health domains."
Do child-Turcotte-Pugh versus MELD score as a predictor of outcome after elective and emergent surgery in cirrhotic patients?,"Our study shows that cirrhotic patients who undergo surgery under general anesthesia have an extremely high 1- and 3-month mortality rate that progressively increases with severity of preoperative liver dysfunction. Additionally, the MELD score correlates well with the CTP score, providing a more objective predictor of postoperative mortality in cirrhotic patients undergoing surgery."
Do children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing generate high-frequency inspiratory sounds during sleep?,HFIS may be a marker of disturbed breathing during sleep in children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy.
Does hungarian cohort-controlled trial of periconceptional multivitamin supplementation show a reduction in certain congenital abnormalities?,The results of this cohort-controlled trial support the findings of the previous Hungarian RCT. The primary prevention of some major structural birth defects by multivitamins containing folic acid or by folic acid has great public health importance.
Is histological dating of timed endometrial biopsy tissue related to fertility status?,Histological dating of the endometrium does not discriminate between women of fertile and infertile couples and should not be used in the routine evaluation of infertility.
Is the presence of citrullinated proteins specific for rheumatoid synovial tissue?,"The presence of citrullinated proteins in the inflamed synovium is not specific for RA, but rather, it may be an inflammation-associated phenomenon. The high specificity of the anti-citrullinated protein antibodies is, therefore, most likely the result of an abnormal humoral response to these proteins."
Is cognitive performance of male adolescents lower than controls across psychiatric disorders : a population-based study?,"As group, adolescent males with psychiatric disorders manifest at least subtle impairments in cognitive functioning."
Does botulinum toxin a have antinociceptive effects in treating interstitial cystitis?,"Our results suggest that BTX-A has an antinociceptive effect on bladder afferent pathways in patients with IC, producing both symptomatic and functional (ie, urodynamic) improvements."
Is the outcome after treatment of venous thromboembolism different in surgical and acutely ill medical patients . Findings from the RIETE registry?,"In patients treated for VTE, the incidences of fatal PE, fatal bleeding, and major bleeding were significantly higher in acutely ill medical patients compared with surgical patients. Given the low percentage of acutely ill medical patients who had received thromboprophylaxis, increasing its use appropriately may reduce the incidence of VTE and associated complications."
Do symptoms as well as tumor size provide prognostic information on patients with localized renal tumors?,In this study we noted that a system combining tumor size and symptoms can accurately stratify patients for predicting survival in those with organ confined renal tumors. Our data support the idea that symptoms should be integrated in further modifications of the TNM system.
Do sentinel lymph node metastases detected by immunohistochemistry only mandate complete axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer?,CALND could have been or was safely omitted in 29 of 29 patients with T1 or T2 primary tumors and metastases detected by IHC. Such patients should be counseled about this low risk before CALND is recommended.
Does ethanol induce expression of the glutamate transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2 in organotypic cortical slice cultures?,Our results are in concert with earlier studies describing the induction of glutamate transport by ethanol. Enhanced expression of EAAT1 and EAAT2 after ethanol exposure can be viewed as a maladaptive process that disposes the developing brain to fetal alcohol syndrome.
Do osteosarcoma cell lines display variable individual reactions on wildtype p53 and Rb tumour-suppressor transgenes?,The application of wildtype tumour-suppressor gene therapy on genetically variable osteosarcomas may be efficient only in yet not identified genetic subgroups of this tumour entity. Hyperactive tumour-suppressor transgenes could be an alternative.
Does selective memory impairment on an adapted Mini-Mental State Examination increase risk of future dementia?,Memory impairment is a risk factor for future dementia in the neurologically-healthy elderly. This can be observed in a subgroup of subjects with SMI defined on the aMMSE delayed-recall subscore. Some other measurements should be added to the SMI construct to improve its predictive validity.
Is low ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine associated with vitamin deficiency in Brazilian pregnant women and newborns?,"Lower maternal cobalamin concentrations are associated with higher tHcy and lower SAM:SAH in newborns. Because SAM:SAH is closely linked with the activity of numerous enzymatic methylation reactions, these results suggest that methylation could be impaired in cobalamin-deficient pregnant women and their newborns."
Is multivitamin-mineral supplementation as efficacious as is iron supplementation in improving hemoglobin concentrations in nonpregnant anemic women living in Mexico?,MM supplements may not be as efficacious as is iron alone in improving the hemoglobin status of anemic women.
Is an algorithm-based genotypic resistance score associated with clinical outcome in HIV-1-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy?,Our study indicates that patients with high-level genotypic drug resistance are at increased risk of developing an HIV-related disease. This association could not be explained by differences in CD4 cell count or HIV RNA levels.
Does severe thrombocytopenia predict outcome in neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis?,"Severe thrombocytopenia within the first 3 days after a diagnosis of NEC suggests a higher likelihood of bowel gangrene, morbidity, and mortality. Prospective studies of infants with early and severe thrombocytopenia may help determine the optimal timing of laparotomy in infants with NEC."
Is early onset of organ failure the best predictor of mortality in acute pancreatitis?,"APACHE II is not reliable for predicting outcome within the first 24 hours after admission and should therefore be used together with other methods. OF mostly develops within the first days after admission, if ever. The time of onset of OF is the most accurate and reliable method for predicting death risk in AP."
Do homocysteine and B vitamins relate to brain volume and white-matter changes in geriatric patients with psychiatric disorders?,"Elevated homocysteine and low folate were associated with radiological markers of neuropathology. Since no patient had clinically deficient folate, it may be important to rethink what defines functionally significant micronutrient deficiency and explore what this means in different age- and health-status groups. Larger samples will be needed to assess interactions between homocysteine, micronutrients, and other neuropathology risk factors."
Is rapid urease test from non-ulcer part of stomach superior to histology from ulcer in detection of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcer?,"Our study shows that rapid urease test has higher detection rate than histological examination of the biopsy specimens obtained from the margins of gastric ulcer in diagnosis of H. pylori infection. Under the consideration of the health insurance payments limitation and elimination of false-negative detection rate of H. pylori infection, we strongly recommend the rapid urease test from the antrum and body specimens rather than from the ulcer margins for detection of the bacteria in patients with gastric ulcer disease."
Does the molecular pathology of experimental testicular torsion suggest adjunct therapy to surgical repair?,"Testicular torsion causes loss of spermatogenesis and a significant increase in germ cell apoptosis due to an increase in testicular oxidative stress concomitant with reperfusion. Oxidative stress arises with recruitment of neutrophils, and the recruitment of neutrophils occurs due to E-selectin expression on the surface of the testicular venules after torsion repair. The cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, activate the stress related kinase pathway to E-selectin expression after torsion repair. Oxidative stress is relieved by infusion of oxygen radical scavengers, which results in a significant salvage of testicular function."
Is cephalic index a useful sonographic marker for trisomy 21 and trisomy 18?,"In this retrospective study, CI was not found to be statistically different between the study and control groups. Although a trend towards significance was seen with T21, this difference is not clinically useful. There may be interethnic differences in the CI between fetuses. CI is not useful for aneuploidy screening by ultrasound."
Is urinary isoflavonoid excretion inversely associated with the ratio of protein to dietary fibre intake in young women?,Supplementation with purified isoflavones results in an increase in urinary isoflavonoid excretion and part of the individual variation in response is associated with an interaction between intakes of protein and dietary fibre. Whether manipulation of these macronutrients could enhance efficacy of isoflavone supplements remains to be determined.
Does overexpression of brain natriuretic peptide facilitate neutrophil infiltration and cardiac matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression after acute myocardial infarction?,These results demonstrate that elevated plasma BNP facilitates neutrophil infiltration of the infarcted area after MI and increases the activity of the MMP-9 they produce. This suggests that BNP plays a key role in the processes of extracellular matrix remodeling and wound-healing during the early phase after acute MI.
Does atorvastatin reduce arterial stiffness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis?,"Atorvastatin significantly reduced arterial stiffness in patients with RA. The greatest improvements were seen in patients with more active disease, suggesting that, in addition to the beneficial effects of cholesterol reduction, immune modulation may contribute to the cardioprotective effect of statins."
Is hemorrhage uncommon in new Alzheimer family with Flemish amyloid precursor protein mutation?,This expands the number of families reported with mutations in the coding region of the amyloid precursor protein gene. Cerebral hemorrhage appears to be less frequent in this family than in the previously reported Flemish pedigree with the same mutation.
Does surfactant replacement therapy on ECMO improve outcome in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia?,"The data from this study suggest that surfactant replacement on ECMO for neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia does not provide significant benefit in the infant's clinical course with respect to survival, length of ECMO course, length of intubation, or subsequent need for supplemental oxygen."
Is quantitative trait locus determining dietary macronutrient intakes located on human chromosome 2p22?,"The results strengthen the hypothesis that chromosome 2p22 harbors genes that influence a variety of obesity-related phenotypes, including macronutrient intakes."
Does pulse pressure variation predict fluid responsiveness following coronary artery bypass surgery?,PPV and SPV can be used to predict whether or not volume expansion will increase CO in postoperative CABG patients. PPV was superior to SPV at predicting fluid responsiveness. Both of these measures were far superior to CVP and PAOP.
Is the first cut the deepest : basic surgical training in ophthalmology?,"There are significant shortcomings in the basic surgical training SHOs receive, particularly in relation to wet lab experience and opportunities to perform full intraocular procedures. SHOs themselves perceive their training as inadequate. Women are disadvantaged in both laboratory and patient-based training, but minority ethnic groups and those who qualified overseas are not."
Does strontium ranelate improve bone resistance by increasing bone mass and improving architecture in intact female rats?,A long-term treatment with strontium ranelate in intact rats is very safe for bone and improves bone resistance by increasing bone mass and improving architecture while maintaining bone stiffness.
Is disc space narrowing associated with an increased vertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal women : the OFELY Study?,"Despite a higher BMD, women with spine OA do not have a reduced risk of fracture. Disc narrowing is associated with a significant increased vertebral fracture risk."
Do inflammatory cells in brush cytology samples correlate with the severity of corneal lesions in atopic keratoconjunctivitis?,Inflammatory cells in brush cytology samples correlated with corneal damage. Evaluation of the relative percentages of inflammatory cells in brush cytology samples is a useful method of assessing disease activity in allergic conjunctival disease.
Is transdermal posterior tibial nerve laser therapy effective in women with interstitial cystitis?,"This study demonstrated no difference between the active and sham device. However, it is interesting that treatment and control cohorts experienced similar improvements, suggesting that the control cohort improvements may have been due to participants' belief that they were receiving active treatment from the stimulator. These findings provide support for investigating placebo effects in randomized trials."
Is soft plaque detected on intravascular ultrasound the strongest predictor of in-stent restenosis : an intravascular ultrasound study?,"Soft plaque detected on IVUS was the strongest predictor of ISR. Soft plaque was compressed more easily by stenting, however, causing more proliferation of neointima subsequently and resulted in a worse prognosis."
Is reflux esophagitis after eradication of Helicobacter pylori associated with the degree of hiatal hernia?,There is a high incidence of RE after successful H. pylori eradication therapy. This incidence of RE was closely associated with the presence and degree of hiatal hernia and with the decrease in gastric juice pH. These findings suggest that the presence of hiatal hernia together with increase in gastric acidity are important determinant factors for the development of RE after successful H. pylori eradication therapy.
Is natural saline-flush sufficient to maintain patency of immobilized-urokinase double-lumen catheter used to provide temporary blood access for hemodialysis?,Natural saline-flush is sufficient for maintaining the patency of an immobilized-urokinase double-lumen central venous catheter.
Does angiotensin II block memory consolidation through an AT2 receptor-dependent mechanism?,"Our data indicate that, when given into CA1, AII blocks memory formation through a mechanism involving activation of AT2 receptors; however, endogenous AII does not seem to participate in the consolidation of IA long-term memory."
Do vitamin E-coated dialyzer membranes downregulate expression of monocyte adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules?,Vitamin E-coated dialyzers induced a less-activated phenotype of monocytes and may improve cellular immunity.
Does night-shift discharge from intensive care unit increase the mortality-risk of ICU survivors?,"At the time of ICU discharge to the ward three factors are predictive of hospital outcome: timing of ICU discharge, limited medical treatment orders and initial illness severity."
Is ovariectomy sufficient to accelerate spontaneous skin ageing and to stimulate ultraviolet irradiation-induced photoageing of murine skin?,"These results suggest that ovariectomy alone is sufficient to accelerate skin ageing and to increase UV sensitivity, which results in the further deterioration of the skin and photoageing, and may account for the accelerated skin ageing seen in postmenopausal women."
Do [ Validation of the French Version of the Life Skills Profile with people suffering of schizophrenia ]?,"The 39-items version of the Life Skills Profile was not validated in French. However, for clinical practice of social rehabilitation, this tool remains useful for a single person to check specific behaviors, which could hinder his/her integration into the community, to plan specific interventions and to evaluate changes, in addition with other scales. By the validation of the short version of the Life Skills Profile, an instrument is at disposal in French for outcome studies which allow to: 1) quickly assess the social functioning of person suffering of schizophrenia by a caregiver or a family member; 2) to detect insufficient skills in specific domains; and 3) to evaluate therapeutic efficiency."
Do familial 22q11.2 deletions in DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome are predominantly smaller than the commonly observed 3Mb?,"Familial del(22)(q11.2) are predominantly smaller than the common deletion size of 3 Mb, indicating that there may be some underlying mechanisms that favor parent-to-child transmission of smaller deletions in individuals with del(22)(q11.2), therefore, underscoring the need to exclude a familial basis in cases of del(22)(q11.2) smaller than 3 Mb."
Do mesangial cells stimulate differentiation of endothelial cells to form capillary-like networks in a three-dimensional culture system?,"Our data indicate that MCs help ECs differentiate toward vascularization, in which the direct cell-cell contact between ECs and MCs plays an important role. VEGF is a mediator in this process."
"Is the pupil a moving target : centration , repeatability , and registration?",The pupil center can have a significant change in position with changing illumination. Wavefront data must be centered on a fixed eye structure rather than the pupil center to ensure that wavefront data captured in scotopic light are appropriately matched to the pupil in the photopic light used at surgery. The goal is to avoid clinically significant decentration of the wavefront between capture and excimer laser application.
Does radiation therapy impact local complication rates after free flap reconstruction for head and neck cancer?,"Our experience suggests that XRT can be safely administered before or after surgery to patients undergoing head and neck free flap reconstruction at an experienced surgical referral center. Postoperative complication rates were not significantly affected by administration, timing, dose, or extent of XRT."
Does institutional commitment to rectal cancer screening result in earlier-stage cancers on diagnosis?,"These data suggest that a monitored institutional directive may significantly increase early detection of rectal cancers. This should result in a greater survival rate and lower local recurrence rate, because survival is predicated on stage at presentation. This may serve as a model for other health-care systems."
Does expression of p27 in residual rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation predict long-term outcome?,Our results indicate that positive p27 expression in rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation is an independent negative predictor of RFS. Expression of p27 in the residual rectal cancer may therefore identify patients with disease likely to be refractory to standard therapy and for whom investigational approaches should be strongly considered.
Are methylxanthines the psycho-pharmacologically active constituents of chocolate?,"A normal portion of chocolate exhibits psychopharmacological activity. The identical profile of effects exerted by cocoa powder and its methylxanthine constituents shows this activity to be confined to the combination of caffeine and theobromine. Methylxanthines may contribute to the popularity of chocolate; however, other attributes are probably much more important in determining chocolate's special appeal and in explaining related self-reports of chocolate cravings and ""chocoholism""."
Do apolipoprotein E promoter polymorphisms have a major influence on the risk of developing primary open angle glaucoma?,Apolipoprotein E promoter polymorphisms are unlikely to have a major impact on the pathophysiology of primary open angle glaucoma.
Does histopathological re-classification of extremity pleomorphic soft tissue sarcoma have clinical relevance?,"These results indicate that histopathological classification of soft tissue pleomorphic sarcomas is clinically relevant. In our experience, AJCC stage and myogenic differentiation are the factors which independently affect prognosis."
Is it possible to help smokers in early motivational stages to quit . The Inter99 study?,High cessation rates were obtained in a population of heavy smokers with moderate nicotine dependence. It was possible to obtain sustained abstinence in smokers in early motivational stages. These smokers would probably not have been reached by traditional smoking campaigns.
Are polycomb homologs involved in teratogenicity of valproic acid in mice?,"We propose that, during embryonic development, VPA may affect the gene silencing pathway mediated by the Polycomb group complex. The epigenetic mechanism of VPA teratogenicity on anteroposterior patterning is suspected."
Does low-intensity exercise and reduction of the risk for fall among at-risk elders?,"This easily implemented, low-intensity exercise program appears to reduce the risk for falls among elderly men and women recovering from recent hospitalizations, bed rest, or both who have low levels of physical functioning."
Is the timing of activity rhythms in patients with dementia related to survival?,"Although rest-activity rhythms as a whole were not related to survival, the timing of the rhythm was. Patients with dementia appear to develop an abnormal timing of their rhythms, which is predictive of shorter survival. It may be possible to intervene with these patients to correct the timing of their rhythms and possibly prolong their lives."
Is fDG-PET able to detect pancreatic carcinoma in chronic pancreatitis?,These data suggest that FDG-PET has a potential role as a diagnostic tool for detecting CA in longstanding CP.
Do bacterial biofilms may contribute to persistent cochlear implant infection?,Bacterial biofilm formation may play a role in recalcitrant cochlear implant infections. This may have profound implications for the treatment of cochlear implant infections.
Do all aggressive lymphoma subtypes share similar outcome after front-line autotransplantation : a matched-control analysis by the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte ( GELA )?,This cohort study confirms the high efficacy of front-line ASCT in responding aggressive B-NHL patients with adverse prognostic factors.
Does the functional angiotensin converting enzyme gene I/D polymorphism alter susceptibility to chronic pancreatitis?,We conclude that the ACE deletion genotype does not make a significant contribution to the pathogenesis and the progression of chronic pancreatitis.
Does older age influence CD4 cell recovery in HIV-1 infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy?,"Although older subjects present a more severe HIV infection, they can achieve, under HAART, the same viro-immunological success as the younger individuals."
Is behaviour of the bowel wall during the first year after surgery a strong predictor of symptomatic recurrence of Crohn 's disease : a prospective study?,Systematic ultrasound follow-up of diseased bowel walls after conservative surgery allows the early identification of patients at high risk of clinical/surgical recurrence.
Does beta2 adrenoceptor gene therapy ameliorate left ventricular dysfunction following cardiac surgery?,Reduced betaAR density and impaired LV function were present following CPB and cardioplegic arrest. Cardiac-selective beta2AR gene transfer during CPB resulted in amelioration of LV dysfunction after cardiac surgery. Such a technique may offer a new approach to post-operative ventricular support.
Are pulsatile wall motion ( PWM ) measurements after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm exclusion useful in the classification of endoleak?,"PWM is permanently reduced after endografting. The smallest reduction in PWM was in patients with type II endoleaks. However, the overlap between the groups does not allow reliable identification of patients having endoleak with PWM-measurements."
Does [ Economical impact of preterm delivery management based on fetal fibronectin result ]?,"By determining fFN for the diagnosis of preterm labor, we obtained savings of 4,620,000 pesos in a 6 month period avoiding unnecessary treatments and hospital stay in patients with negative fFN. Determination of fFN in cervical vaginal secretion in patients with symptoms of preterm labor showed to have high sensitivity and specificity in predicting preterm labor between 24-34 weeks of gestation, permitting a more rational use of medical management and resources and avoiding unnecessary treatments. The treatment instituted on the basis of an opportune diagnosis in patients with positive fFN showed to prolong weeks of gestation. Although a persistence of morbidity and mortality of prematurity has been reported, these have diminished in comparison with studies previously done in the institution."
Does oral budesonide therapy improve quality of life in patients with collagenous colitis?,Quality of life is seriously reduced in patients with collagenous colitis. Six-week treatment with oral budesonide controlled-release capsules significantly improves quality of life and clinical symptoms compared with placebo in these patients.
Does lycopene enhance UVA-induced DNA damage and expression of heme oxygenase-1 in cultured mouse embryo fibroblasts?,"These results demonstrate that lycopene enhances UVA-induced oxidative stress in C3H cells, and they suggest that under UVA irradiation, lycopene may produce oxidative products that are responsible for the prooxidant effects."
"Are neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS ) positive retinal amacrine cells altered in the DBA/2NNia mouse , a murine model for angle-closure glaucoma?",We previously described a parafoveal loss of nNOS positive amacrine cells in the monkey glaucoma model. The fact that there is also a significant decrease of nNOS amacrine cells in the glaucomatous mouse eye indicates a specific response of nNOS positive amacrine cells in glaucomatous retinopathy.
Is maternal meiosis II nondisjunction in trisomy 21 associated with maternal low socioeconomic status?,"Maternal lifetime exposure to poor socioeconomic environment is a risk factor for a trisomy 21, particularly if nondisjunction leads to a maternal meiosis II."
Are increases in serum levels of troponin I associated with cardiac dysfunction and disease severity in pediatric patients with septic shock?,"Troponin I was increased in >50% of septic children early in their illness. Increased admission troponin I was associated with decreased measures of systolic cardiac function, as measured by echocardiography, and correlated with severity of illness. Early myocardial cell injury may contribute to the development of subsequent organ failure in septic shock, and measuring troponin I on admission may be helpful in assessing severity of sepsis."
Does ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction enhance VEGF gene delivery to the infarcted myocardium in rats?,UMMD is a noninvasive method to effectively improve the delivery of targeted genes to the heart.
Do effects of varied dimensions of surgical guides on implant angulations?,"Within the limitations of this study, the results suggest channel length as the primary controlling factor in minimizing deviated angulations."
Is number of good quality embryos on day 3 predictive for both pregnancy and implantation rates in in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles?,"The number of good quality embryos available on day 3 is a strong predictive value for both pregnancy rate and implantation rate. When good quality embryos are present on day 3, only two embryos should be transferred to minimize multiple pregnancies."
Is the lymphotoxin-beta receptor critical for control of murine Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis?,Lymphotoxin alpha 1 beta 2 /lymphotoxin-beta receptor interactions are critical for immunity against Citrobacter rodentium in mice. Impaired anti-enteropathogenic Escherichia coli immunity may be anticipated in anti-lymphotoxin-beta receptor-directed therapy for human inflammatory bowel disease.
Is interferon-gamma expression an independent prognostic factor in ovarian cancer?,Elevated interferon-gamma expression correlates with improved clinical outcome in patients with ovarian cancer.
Does combined bone morphogenetic protein-2 and -7 gene transfer enhance osteoblastic differentiation and spine fusion in a rodent model?,Combined BMP2 and BMP7 gene transfer is significantly more effective in inducing osteoblastic differentiation and spine fusion than individual BMP gene transfer.
Does laparoscopic colorectal surgery modify risk factors for postoperative morbidity?,"In the laparoscopic group, both postoperative morbidity and length of stay were significantly reduced and most risk factors for postoperative morbidity disappeared."
Do polymorphisms in neprilysin gene affect the risk of Alzheimer 's disease in Finnish patients?,"Taken together, these findings suggest that polymorphisms in the NEP gene increase risk for AD and support a potential role for NEP in AD."
"Is blood manganese concentration elevated in iron deficiency anemia patients , whereas globus pallidus signal intensity is minimally affected?","Although blood Mn is elevated in IDA patients, there is no increase in globus pallidus MRI signal intensity. These findings stand in contrast to those of our other studies showing patients with chronic liver disease or occupational Mn exposure have elevated signal intensities remarkably."
Is zinc plus beta-carotene supplementation of pregnant women superior to beta-carotene supplementation alone in improving vitamin A status in both mothers and infants?,"Zinc supplementation during pregnancy improved the vitamin A status of mothers and infants postpartum, which indicates a specific role of zinc in vitamin A metabolism. Addition of both beta-carotene and zinc to iron supplements during pregnancy could be effective in improving the vitamin A status of mothers and infants."
Does childhood sexual abuse predict poor outcome seven years after parasuicide?,"The findings support the growing body of evidence linking the characteristic symptoms of borderline personality disorder to childhood sexual abuse, and identify sexual abuse rather than a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder as a predictor for poor outcome after a parasuicide. The findings are relevant to our understanding and treatment of parasuicide patients, especially those who fulfil the present criteria for borderline personality disorder."
Does leflunomide inhibit transendothelial migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells?,"LEF-M reduces monocytic adhesion molecule expression and TEM and may thus interfere with monocyte and EC activities in RA. Thus, the clinical effects of leflunomide may, at least in part, be due to blocking cell traffic into the inflamed synovia."
Are maternal soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type 2 ( sTNFR2 ) and adiponectin both related to blood pressure during gestation and infant 's birthweight?,Maternal sTNFR2 and adiponectin are independently related to both maternal blood pressure and infant's birthweight in uncomplicated pregnancy. The contributions of the TNF-alpha system and adiponectin to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and fetal growth merit further studies.
Is embryo transfer equally effective at cleavage stage and blastocyst stage : a randomized prospective study?,The overall implantation and pregnancy rates after embryo transfer at cleavage stage and at blastocyst stage transfer were not statistically different. Women who had at least one good quality blastocyst (n = 25) had a high pregnancy rate (60% per ET). Blastocyst transfer is a good alternative for couples with many good quality embryos on day 2 after insemination.
Is why integration key for dental office technology?,"Integration is crucial to the efficient and effective functioning of the dental office. However, practitioners cannot do much when industry does not integrate its products sufficiently. The industry, therefore, should adopt user-centered design principles, and its designers should work together to improve the integration of products from different vendors."
Does previous thoracic surgery increase peri-operative mortality in pediatric heart-lung transplant recipients?,"We conclude that previous thoracic surgery in HLT recipients does not significantly increase blood product transfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass time or peri-operative mortality."
Does frequent use of alternative airway techniques make difficult intubations less and easier?,"In elective general anesthesia, frequent use of the alternative airway techniques, such as LMA for a surgical procedure of short duration and lighting stylet for a possibly difficult airway, will decrease the events of difficult intubations. Lighting stylet seems more advantageous than laryngoscope in management of difficult intubation caused by poor laryngoscopic view."
Is survival after resection for lung cancer the outcome that matters?,Pulmonary resection offers high disease-free survival for early-stage lung cancer. Decentralized hospital computer programming (DHCP) allows individual oncology programs to reliably measure survival. Use of this important outcome measure in quality improvement programs facilitates realistic counseling of patients and meaningful assessments of practice effectiveness.
Is aPC genotype a prognostic factor in familial adenomatous polyposis patients with colorectal cancer?,These data do not support the hypothesis that APC mutation may influence the outcome of familial adenomatous polyposis cases affected by colorectal cancer.
Is systole-diastole mismatch in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by stress induced left ventricular outflow tract obstruction?,"In HCM, systolic period increases abnormally with stress. This is not because of a loss of inotropy, but is directly related to the degree of LV outflow tract obstruction. As a result, the diastolic period fails to increase, reducing the time available for coronary flow, the LV filling pattern is modified, and the diastolic atrioventricular pressure gradient increases. These changes may contribute to symptom development and suggest why reducing LV outflow tract obstruction per se may be therapeutically useful in HCM."
Does the causes of false-positive medial branch ( facet joint ) block in soldiers and retirees?,"Although a high incidence of epidural and foraminal spread occurs during the performance of MBB, this is unlikely to be a significant cause of false-positive blocks."
Is temporal evolution of water diffusion parameters different in grey and white matter in human ischaemic stroke?,The values and temporal evolution of <D> and FA are different for grey and white matter after human ischaemic stroke. The observation that there is patient-to-patient variability in the degree of white matter structure remaining within the infarct at three months may have implications for predicting patient outcome.

Is abnormal p53 immunohistochemistry associated with an increased colorectal cancer-related mortality in patients with ulcerative colitis?,"Abnormal p53 immunohistochemistry of tumors is associated with a poor prognosis among ulcerative colitis patients who develop colorectal cancer. As such, p53 immunohistochemical staining could be a useful histological marker to complement routine histology in cancer surveillance programs in ulcerative colitis patients."
Does a culture system using human foreskin fibroblasts as feeder cells allow production of human embryonic stem cells?,"We used successfully human foreskin fibroblasts as feeder cells for derivation and continued undifferentiated growth of hES cells. These feeder cells are convenient for IVF units, because no fetal human tissues or tissue from operations are needed."
Are plasma fatty acid composition and depression associated in the elderly : the Rotterdam Study?,"In community-dwelling persons, fatty acid composition is related to depression. Because this relation was not secondary to inflammation, atherosclerosis, or possible confounders, it suggests a direct effect of fatty acid composition on mood."
Do an update on the genetics of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome?,There is considerable data that suggests that: (1). genetic factors play an important role in the manifestation of GTS; (2). several genes are important with some possibly having major effect; and (3). several regions of the genome have been identified as potential locations of these susceptibility genes.
Is latent inhibition in 35-day-old rats an `` adult '' latent inhibition : implications for neurodevelopmental models of schizophrenia?,"The results point to functionality within brain systems regulating LI acquisition but not those regulating LI expression in periadolescent rats, further suggesting that postpubertal maturation of the latter systems may underlie schizophrenia-mimicking LI disruption reported in adult rats following perinatal manipulations and possibly disrupted LI observed in schizophrenia."
Do geographic variation of pediatric burn injuries in a metropolitan area?,"This study shows the utility of geographic mapping in providing information about injury patterns within a defined area. The combination of mapping injury rates and spatial statistical analysis provides a detailed level of injury surveillance, allowing for identification of small geographic areas with elevated rates of specific injuries."

These statistics are similar to the salvage rates found with the similar management approach of intravaginal torsion.
Are adhesion molecules CD171 ( L1CAM ) and CD24 expressed by primary neuroendocrine carcinomas of the skin ( Merkel cell carcinomas )?,"Expression of CD171 and CD24 is found in most neuroendocrine carcinomas of the skin, which may be used diagnostically. Further studies will assess whether this feature may contribute to metastasis of neuroendocrine carcinomas of the skin by facilitating transendothelial migration or tumor cell dissemination as has been suggested for other malignancies."
Does insulin increase CSF Abeta42 levels in normal older adults?,These findings are consistent with recent in vitro studies of insulin effects on Abeta and support the notion that insulin may modulate Abeta42 levels acutely in humans.
Does low level methylmercury exposure affect neuropsychological function in adults?,"This study suggests that adults exposed to MeHg may be at risk for deficits in neurocognitive function. The functions disrupted in adults, namely attention, fine-motor function and verbal memory, are similar to some of those previously reported in children with prenatal exposures."
Are cognitive functions affected by dietary fatty acids in elderly subjects in the Pro.V.A . study population?,"In free-living elderly subjects, moderate to severe cognitive impairment is not associated with dietary fatty acids."
Does oral infection with a periodontal pathogen accelerate early atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-null mice?,"Oral infection with P gingivalis accelerates early atherosclerosis. Thus, uncovering the underlying mechanisms is critical for the design of preventive and therapeutic strategies targeting atherosclerotic vascular disease and its sequelae."
Does repeated exposure to blue light improve psoriasis?,Repeated exposure to blue light did not improve psoriasis.
Is lower sperm aneuploidy frequency associated with high pregnancy rates in ICSI programmes?,This study showed that chromosomally abnormal sperm have a negative impact on ICSI outcome.
Does trypsinogen activation peptide ( TAP ) expression in gallbladder bile identify bilio-pancreatic carcinoma?,Gallbladder bile TAP concentration discriminates between benign and malignant lesions of the bilio-pancreatic system. In the case of benign disease there is a significantly higher TAP concentration in the case of acute inflammation.
Do tumor microcirculation and diffusion predict therapy outcome for primary rectal carcinoma?,Perfusion indices and apparent diffusion coefficients inside the tumor region seem to be of predictive value for therapy outcome of preoperative therapy in patients with primary rectal carcinoma. Higher parameter levels in the nonresponding group could be explained by increased shunt flow or increased angiogenic activity in aggressive tumor cell clusters resulting in reduced nutrients supply and higher fraction of intratumoral necrosis respectively.
Is bDNF upregulated by postnatal development and visual experience : quantitative and immunohistochemical analyses of BDNF in the rat retina?,"These observations indicate that BDNF expression in RGCs is upregulated in an activity-dependent manner, whereas that in Müller cells is regulated only by development."
Is familial atrial fibrillation a genetically heterogeneous disorder?,"Familial AF is more common than previously recognized, highlighting the importance of genetics in disease pathogenesis. In four families with AF, we have excluded linkage to chromosome 10q22-q24, establishing that at least two disease genes are responsible for this disorder."
Is a biologically important single nucleotide polymorphism within the toll-like receptor-4 gene associated with rheumatoid arthritis?,The TLR-4 +896 polymorphism does not appear to influence susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis.
Is a postnatal fasting plasma glucose useful in determining which women with gestational diabetes should undergo a postnatal oral glucose tolerance test?,"In our population, a 6-week postnatal fasting plasma glucose is useful in determining which women with gestational diabetes should undergo an OGTT. Consequently we now perform OGTT only in women whose postnatal fasting plasma glucose is > or =6.0 mmol/l."
Does major hepatic resection reduce the probability of intrahepatic recurrences following resection of colorectal carcinoma liver metastases?,Major hepatic resection is more effective in reducing the risk of intrahepatic recurrences than limited hepatic resection in patients with resectable colorectal carcinoma liver metastases.
Does the disconnected brain stem support rapid eye movement sleep rebound following selective deprivation?,"Rebound in rapid eye movement sleep after deprivation cannot be sustained by the brain stem alone; in contrast, rapid eye movement sleep pressure persisted in the decerebrate cat, demonstrating that this process does not depend on descending forebrain influences. This indicates that rebound and pressure are 2 different components of the recovery process after rapid eye movement sleep deprivation and that, as such, are likely controlled by different mechanisms."
Is a length polymorphism in the circadian clock gene Per3 linked to delayed sleep phase syndrome and extreme diurnal preference?,The length of the Per3 repeat region identifies a potential genetic marker for extreme diurnal preference.
Are spousal responses differentially associated with clinical variables in women and men with chronic pain?,"These results extend previous findings demonstrating a relationship between spousal responses and patients' adjustment to pain; however, the pattern of these effects appears to be moderated by the sex of the patient. Implications for assessment and treatment of chronic pain are discussed."

Does prenatal care reduce the impact of illicit drug use on perinatal outcomes?,"In infants exposed to IDU, a reduction in risk for prematurity, LBW, and SGA, was consistently demonstrated with improved levels of PNC. In high-risk populations, health care should seek to reach mothers early, especially those identified at risk for IDU, and deliver PNC to them effectively."
Is initial signaling of the fibronectin receptor ( alpha5beta1 integrin ) in hepatic stellate cells independent of tyrosine phosphorylation?,"The alpha(5)beta(1) integrin-ligand interaction induces accumulation of cytoskeletal molecules, activating multiple kinase pathways. Initial integrin signaling by alpha(5)beta(1) are associated with cytoskeletal proteins and are independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. We suggest that there may be cytoskeletal changes that may be targeted to diminish HSC activation."
Are sTI571-resistant KT-1 cells sensitive to interferon-alpha accompanied by the loss of T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase and prolonged phosphorylation of Stat1?,We demonstrated that STI571-resistance does not confer cross-resistance to IFN-alphain KT-1 cells. The loss of TC-PTP contributed to the IFN-alpha-induced prolonged phosphorylation of Stat1 and the higher sensitivity to IFN-alpha in KTR cells.
Does chronic exposure to anticholinergic medications adversely affect the course of Alzheimer disease?,"Although very preliminary, these data suggest that concomitant therapy with anticholinergics may be associated with significant deleterious effects on acetylcholinesterase therapy, or, more speculatively, that chronic exposure to anticholinergics may have adverse effects on the clinical course of AD."
Does wada memory performance predict seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery in children?,Results suggest that Wada memory performance asymmetries are related to the degree of seizure relief after epilepsy surgery in children and adolescents.
Is neither antisocial personality disorder nor antisocial alcoholism associated with the MAO-A gene in Han Chinese males?,"No significant association was observed between these two polymorphisms and antisocial personality disorder with alcoholism, either individually or for the haplotype, or for antisocial personality disorder without alcoholism. Thus, neither antisocial alcoholism nor antisocial personality disorder was associated with the genetic variants of MAO-A gene."
Do quantitative accuracy of dopaminergic neurotransmission imaging with ( 123 ) I SPECT?,"Accurate estimates of striatal uptake and BP in (123)I brain SPECT are feasible with PVC, even with small errors in registering SPECT with anatomic data or in segmenting the striata."
Does early physical activity intervention prevent decrease of bone strength in very low birth weight infants?,There is a significant postnatal decrease in the bone SOS of very low birth weight infants. A brief range-of-motion exercise attenuates the decrease in bone strength and may decrease the risk of osteopenia.
Is productive HIV-2 infection in the brain restricted to macrophages/microglia?,"The productively infected cells in the brains of HIV-2 infected individuals are macrophages/microglia. No evidence was found for productive infection of astrocytes, neurons or oligodendrocytes. Thus, the broader in vitro cell tropism, promiscuous coreceptor usage and relative independence of CD4 by HIV-2 compared to HIV-1 does not broaden its range of target cells in the brain."
Does wireless capsule endoscopy detect small bowel ulcers in patients with normal results from state of the art enteroclysis?,Our data indicates that WCE may be more sensitive for small bowel ulcers than the best enteroclysis available.
Does adding angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition limit myocyte remodeling after myocardial infarction?,"Compared with ACEI alone, the addition of ARB further limits adjacent noninfarcted myocyte hypertrophy during post-MI LV remodeling. Both ACEI alone and CT preserve isolated unloaded myocyte function, but neither significantly reduce interstitial collagen. The additional benefit of ARB on regional and global function in vivo may also be due to other factors including regional load."

Does rhTSH stimulation before radioiodine therapy in thyroid cancer reduce the effective half-life of ( 131 ) I?,"The use of rhTSH for stimulation of TSH before RIT is safe but also significantly reduces the effective half-life of (131)I. This is mainly due to a reduced renal iodine clearance in the hypothyroid state, but the bioavailability of radioiodine may be slightly overestimated because of larger amounts of intestinal (131)I after endogenous TSH stimulation."
"Are the superior results of living-donor renal transplantation completely caused by selection or short cold ischemia time : a single-center , multivariate analysis?","The superior results of LD versus PMD transplantations can be partly explained by the dichotomy in the cold ischemia period in these populations (selection). However, after adjustment for cold ischemia periods, the influence of donor origin still remained significant, independent of any of the variables introduced. This superiority is possibly caused by factors inherent to the transplanted organ itself, for example, the absence of brain death and cardiovascular instability of the donor before nephrectomy."
Is maternal and fetal outcomes if gestational impaired glucose tolerance treated?,"There is increased independent association between cesarean section rate, prematurity, LGA, and macrosomic infants born to mothers with untreated IGT. Most of the children were healthy, but there is still increased morbidity. Therefore, to evaluate the effects of treatment, there is a need for a randomized study."
Do alcoholic men endorse more DSM-IV withdrawal symptoms than alcoholic women matched in drinking history?,"DSM criteria provide a similar characterization of alcohol dependence in male and female research volunteers. Despite this similarity, the DSM criteria were sensitive to gender differences, which can now be challenged with rigorous testing."
Does education modify the relation of AD pathology to level of cognitive function in older persons?,These data provide strong evidence that the relation between senile plaques and level of cognitive function differs by years of formal education.

Does chronic exposure to nicotine prevent neurocognitive decline after cardiac surgery?,"This study confirmed previous findings that age, baseline cognitive function, years of education, and impaired left ventricular function are independent predictors of neurocognitive decline at 6 weeks after CABG surgery. Smoking is neither preventive nor causative of cognitive decline after CABG surgery."
Do non-pathogenic bacteria modulate colonic epithelial gene expression in germ-free mice?,"Non-pathogenic bacteria modulated colonic gene expression in germ-free mice, suggesting that non-pathogenic bacteria possibly initiate epithelial change in genetically normal and/or abnormal hosts. The present study provides a basis for the functional study of each molecule in symbiosis with luminal bacteria in healthy and diseased colon."
Is high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging a noninvasive method of observing injury and recovery in the peripheral nervous system?,"In this study, we demonstrated the ability of MRI to noninvasively monitor injury and recovery in the peripheral nervous system, by demonstrating changes in nerve and muscle that correlated with histological and behavioral evidence of axonal degeneration and regeneration. This study demonstrates the potential of MRI to distinguish traumatic peripheral nerve injuries that recover through axonal regeneration (i.e., axonotmetic grade) from those that do not and therefore require surgical repair (i.e., neurotmetic grade). This diagnostic modality could improve treatment by providing earlier and more accurate diagnoses of nerve damage, as well as reducing the need for exploratory surgery."
Is a functional single nucleotide polymorphism ( V158M ) in the COMT gene associated with aggressive personality traits?,"These findings support the hypothesis that the functional polymorphism in the COMT gene may modify the phenotype of suicide attempts and anger-related traits. This, however, being a novel finding, should warrant further investigation."
Does implicit memory vary as a function of hypnotic electroencephalogram stage in surgical patients?,"In this study, implicit memory was observed during general anesthesia at light to moderate, but not deep, hypnotic stages. Hypnotic stages were determined by a commercial electroencephalogram device, and implicit memory was measured by using a postoperative reading speed task. During lighter phases of anesthesia, patients should be protected against acoustic information that could negatively influence their postoperative outcome."

Do growth and nutritional indexes in early life predict pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis?,Aggressive intervention early in life aimed at growth and nutrition and/or lung disease may affect pulmonary function.
Is the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 involved in non-canonical Wnt5a/JNK signalling pathway?,Our findings indicate that Wnt5a and Ror2 interact physically and functionally. Ror2 may thus act as a receptor for Wnt5a to activate non-canonical Wnt signalling.
Does recognition memory for unfamiliar faces differ for adult normal and dyslexic readers : an event-related brain potential study?,These results show that a previously described recognition memory deficit for words in dyslexic readers is likely to be specific for verbal material.
Does alcohol intoxication induce greater reductions in brain metabolism in male than in female subjects?,"This study shows a markedly blunted sensitivity to the effects of acute alcohol on brain glucose metabolism in female subjects that may reflect gender differences in alcohol's modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission. The greater behavioral effects of alcohol in female subjects despite the blunted metabolic responses could reflect other effects of alcohol, for which the regional metabolic signal may be hidden within the large decrements in metabolism that occur during alcohol intoxication."
Does exploratory subsetting of autism families based on savant skills improve evidence of genetic linkage to 15q11-q13?,"These data are consistent with the genetic contribution of a 15q locus to autism susceptibility in a subset of affected individuals exhibiting savant skills. Similar types of skills have been noted in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome, which results from deletions of this chromosomal region."
Does normalisation of biochemical markers of bone formation correlate with clinical benefit from therapy in metastatic breast cancer?,"Clinical benefit from systemic therapy was primarily accompanied by a normalization of biochemical markers representing bone formation. This result reflects the physiology of the ""bone remodeling unit"". In patients without this normalization, thorough and early restaging is warranted since the systemic therapy may be ineffective."
Do [ Establishment of an animal model of blast-fragment combine injury on facial nerve ]?,The dog's traumatic model established by impact wave and segment in this experiment is an appropriate animal model for the research of explosive effect on facial nerves because of its controllable and repeatable injuring conditions.
Is dendritic development of Drosophila high order visual system neurons independent of sensory experience?,"Overall, our results indicate no role for visual experience in the development of VS dendrites, while spontaneous activity from photoreceptors may play at most a subtle role in the formation of fully complex dendrites in these high-order visual processing neurons."
Does amiodarone reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting?,"Postoperative intravenous amiodarone, followed by oral amiodarone, appears to be effective in the prevention of new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation. It also reduces ventricular rate and duration of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting. It is well tolerated and decreases the length of hospital stay."
Does a common polymorphism in KCNH2 ( HERG ) hasten cardiac repolarization?,"As confirmed in modeling studies, these changes are expected to shorten action potential duration by an increase in I(Kr). This recapitulates the shorter QTc in females homozygous for the 2690C-allele."
Is fine motor dexterity correlated to social functioning in schizophrenia?,"Various neuropsychological measures correlated to social functioning, the correlation involving fine motor dexterity being the strongest one. Future studies of the prediction of social functioning in schizophrenia should include fine motor dexterity."
Do gamma-radiation sensitivity and polymorphisms in RAD51L1 modulate glioma risk?,"These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity."
Is salivary cortisol release and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis feedback sensitivity in fibromyalgia associated with depression but not with pain?,The presented data suggest depression to be an important factor in HPA axis-related dysfunction in fibromyalgia. This might be one explanation for equivocal findings in the literature.
Is 18F-FAMT-PET useful for the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in operable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma?,Our findings suggest that the addition of (18)F-FAMT-PET to (18)F-FDG-PET and CT would permit more precise staging of esophageal cancer.

Do nondependent stimulant users of cocaine and prescription amphetamines show verbal learning and memory deficits?,"These results support the hypothesis of subtle and possibly pre-existing neurocognitive deficiencies in occasional users of stimulants, which might be related to the motivation for using these drugs. More importantly, despite beneficial short-term effects, cumulative use, particularly of prescription amphetamines and methylphenidate, intensifies these deficits."
Is cognitive function related to fronto-striatal serotonin transporter levels -- a brain PET study in young healthy subjects?,"The results imply that in healthy subjects, high SERT binding in fronto-striatal regions is associated with better performance on tasks involving executive function and logical reasoning."
Does transcriptional profiling of polycythemia vera identify gene expression patterns both dependent and independent from the action of JAK2V617F?,"A subset of the aberrant gene expression in PV progenitor cells can be attributed to the action of the mutant kinase, but there remain a significant number of genes characteristic of the disease but deregulated by as yet unknown mechanisms. Genes deregulated in PV as a result of the action of JAK2V617F or independent of the kinase may represent other targets for therapy."
Is helicobacter pylori a major public health priority in western Balkans : an endoscopy referral center experience?,This is the first attempt in western Balkans to demonstrate by routine gastroscopy and biopsy that there is a significantly higher prevalence of H. pylori and active gastritis in Albanians as compared to Greeks.
Is entecavir an optional agent to prevent hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) reactivation : a review of 16 patients?,This study suggests that ETV is a useful option for preventing HBV reactivation in patients with chronic HBV infection.
Does electromagnetic-guided dynamic multileaf collimator tracking enable motion management for intensity-modulated arc therapy?,Electromagnetic-guided DMLC target tracking with IMAT has been investigated for the first time. Dose distributions to moving targets with DMLC tracking were significantly superior to those without tracking. There was no loss of treatment efficiency with DMLC tracking.
Do preoperative prediction of intensive care unit stay following cardiac surgery?,"Twelve independent preoperative risk factors for a prolonged ICU stay following cardiac surgery were identified and constructed into a proportional hazards model. Using this risk model, one can predict whether a patient will have a prolonged ICU stay or not."
"Are serum IL-6 , albumin and co-morbidities closely correlated with symptoms of depression in patients on maintenance haemodialysis?","Maintenance haemodialysis patients with symptoms of depression may have higher serum IL-6 and lower serum albumin levels. The prevalence of depression was lower in elderly patients at or above 75 years old, and no correlation was found with socio-economic status. Factors including co-morbid conditions, serum IL-6, albumin and age may help predict which patients may be predisposed to develop symptoms of depression."
Are hER3 and downstream pathways involved in colonization of brain metastases from breast cancer?,"Deregulated HER family receptors, particularly HER3, and their downstream pathways are implicated in colonization of brain metastasis. The need for HER family receptors to dimerize for activation suggests that tumors may be susceptible to combinations of anti-HER family inhibitors, and may even be effective in the absence of HER2 amplification (that is, in triple negative/basal cancers). However, the presence of activating mutations in PIK3CA, HRAS, KRAS and NRAS suggests the necessity for also specifically targeting downstream molecules."
Does ovarian stimulation affect the levels of regulatory endometrial NK cells and angiogenic cytokine VEGF?,Hormonal therapy for ovarian stimulation may be associated with poor endometrial vascularization. Local injury before the implantation window seems not to influence endometrial angiogenic parameters altered by ovarian stimulation.
Are gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with liver cirrhosis linked to impaired quality of life and psychological distress?,GI symptoms are linked to QoL and psychological distress in patients with liver cirrhosis.
Does paclitaxel ameliorate fibrosis in hepatic stellate cells via inhibition of TGF-beta/Smad activity?,"These data indicate that 200 nmol/L paclitaxel ameliorates hepatic fibrosis via modulating TGF-beta signaling, and that paclitaxel may have some therapeutic value in humans with hepatic fibrosis."
Is pRKCH gene polymorphism associated with the risk of severe gastric atrophy?,"This was the first study to examine the associations of the PRKCH polymorphism with GA and GC, and suggested that the AA genotype, relative to the G/G genotype, may be a higher risk genotype for severe GA."
Does cytokeratin 18-based modification of the MELD score improve prediction of spontaneous survival after acute liver injury?,The CK18 M65-based MELD score has superior sensitivity and specifically predicts survival of ALF patients. Further prospective clinical studies could validate its potential role to predict requirement of LTx in ALF patients.
Does the PediaSat continuous central SvO2 monitoring system reliably indicate state or course of central venous oxygenation?,"In paediatric and adolescent patients undergoing major surgery, the PediaSat system did not reliably reflect SCO-OXcvO2 values and cannot replace repeated invasive ScvO2 assessments in the clinically relevant range of ScvO2."
Are eye movement disorders different in Parkin-linked and idiopathic early-onset PD?,"Although clinically similarly affected, symptomatic Parkin mutation carriers and patients with idiopathic EOPD differed in several oculomotor tasks. This finding may point to distinct anatomic structures underlying either condition: dysfunctions of cortical areas involved in smooth pursuit (V5, frontal eye field) in Parkin-linked parkinsonism vs greater impairment of basal ganglia circuits in idiopathic Parkinson disease."
Does inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling increase microvascular hemorrhaging and venular remodeling in adult rats?,"Together, our results suggest that canonical Wnt inhibition plays an important role in microvascular remodeling, specifically venular remodeling."
Do manometry data support a novel concept of the lower esophageal sphincter system?,"Based on available data, we propose a novel concept that better explains the structure-function relationship of the LES. Improved knowledge of the biomechanical factors of esophageal disorders can be expected to advance surgical treatment for these diseases."

Our data suggest that for this subset of patients, prostatectomy alone may not be adequate for local control. This is a novel and relevant marker that should be evaluated for improved risk stratification of patients who may be candidates for adjuvant radiation therapy to improve local control."
Is soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products ( sRAGE ) in plasma and synovial fluid inversely associated with disease severity of knee osteoarthritis?,"sRAGE levels were significantly lower in OA patients compared with controls, and sRAGE levels in plasma and synovial fluid also decreased significantly as the disease severity increased. Accordingly, sRAGE levels could be used as a biochemical marker for assessing the severity and progression of knee OA."
Do central memory CD4+ T cells dominate the normal cerebrospinal fluid?,"This study reports reference values of absolute numbers and percentages of WBC subsets in CSF, which are essential for further investigation of the immunopathogenesis of neuro-inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the relative abundance of CD4(+) T cells, mainly with a central memory phenotype, and the presence of dendritic cells in CSF suggests an active adaptive immune response under normal conditions in the central nervous system (CNS)."

A systematic review?,"Evidence for the effect of physiotherapy on adolescents and adults with cerebral palsy is sparse, and therefore there is an urgent need for well-designed physiotherapeutic trials for these people."
Does starvation alter the liver transcriptome of the innate immune response in Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar )?,We demonstrate that both starvation and infection have profound effects on transcription in the liver of salmon. There was a significant effect on the transcriptional response to infection depending on the prior feeding regime of the fish. It is likely that the energy demands on protein synthesis for acute phase response proteins are relatively high in the starved fish which have reduced energy reserves. This has implications for dietary control of fish if an immune response is anticipated.

Do endothelial cells stimulate growth of normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells in 3D culture?,Breast endothelial cells - beside their role in transporting nutrients and oxygen to tissues - are vital component of the epithelial microenvironment in the breast and provide proliferative signals to the normal and malignant breast epithelium. These growth promoting effects of endothelial cells should be taken into consideration in breast cancer biology.
Does atorvastatin attenuate hepatic fibrosis in rats after bile duct ligation via decreased turnover of hepatic stellate cells?,"This study shows that very early atorvastatin treatment inhibits HSC activation and fibrosis in the BDL model in vivo, while late treatment reduces HSC turnover and activity. Our findings underline that long-term studies in humans are warranted."
Does social vulnerability predict cognitive decline in a prospective cohort of older Canadians?,"Increasing social vulnerability, defined by using a social vulnerability index incorporating many social factors, was associated with increased odds of cognitive decline during a period of 5 years in this study of older Canadians. Further study of social vulnerability in relation to cognition is warranted, with particular attention to potential interventions to alleviate its burden."
Does socioeconomic status in one 's childhood predict offspring cardiovascular risk?,"Our study suggests that the SES environment parents grow up in may influence physical health across generations, here, SBP and CRP in their children, and hence that intergenerational histories are important to consider in predicting cardiovascular health in youth."
Does timing of intervention affect brain electrical activity in children exposed to severe psychosocial neglect?,The dependence on age of placement for the effects observed on high frequency EEG alpha power suggests a sensitive period after which brain activity in the face of severe psychosocial deprivation is less amenable to recovery.
Does chinese medicine Nao-Shuan-Tong attenuate cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting apoptosis in a rat model of stroke?,"These findings demonstrate that NST is neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia and is likely to act via inhibition of neuronal apoptosis associated with changes in levels of caspases-3 and -8, Bax and Bcl-2."
Does vascular smooth muscle cell peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ deletion promote abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"In this study, we identify PPARγ as an important contributor in attenuating the development of aortic aneurysms by demonstrating that loss of PPARγ in vascular SMCs promotes aortic dilatation and elastin degradation. Thus, PPARγ activation may be potentially promising medical therapy in reducing the risk of AAA progression and rupture."
Does risperidone overdose cause extrapyramidal effects but not cardiac toxicity?,Risperidone taken alone in overdose causes minimal effects. Tachycardia and dystonic reactions were the main features of toxicity. Significant cardiac and other neurological features seem to be uncommon.
Are plasma BDNF and tPA associated with late-onset geriatric depression?,Plasma BDNF and tPA levels are associated with LGD. The complex mechanism of BDNF and tPA in LGD should be further explored in future studies.
Do identifying loci for the overlap between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder using a genome-wide QTL linkage approach?,"Our findings suggest that QTLs identified in this study are ASD specific, although the 15q QTL potentially has pleiotropic effects for ADHD and ASD. This study confirms that genetic factors influence ASD traits along a continuum of severity, as loci potentially underlying ASD symptoms in children with ADHD were identified even though subjects with autism had been excluded from the IMAGE sample, and supports the hypothesis that differential genetic factors underlie the three ASD dimensions."
Do eye gaze during face processing in children and adolescents with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome?,These results provide evidence for abnormal exploration of faces in the syndrome and suggest that time spent on the eyes may contribute to face processing difficulties and interact with anxiety levels to exacerbate socio-emotional dysfunction in affected individuals.

Continued understanding of multifactorial contributions to the anterior cruciate ligament injury mechanism should dictate future injury screening and prevention efforts in order to successfully cater to individual joint vulnerabilities.
Does tumor histology affect the accuracy of clinical evaluative staging in primary lung cancer?,"In adenocarcinoma patients with pathologic N2 disease, clinical N-status and metastatic pathologic N2 stations were significant prognostic factors. A similar difference was not found in patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma appear to have different tendencies for lymph node metastasis."
Do breast carcinoma cells re-express E-cadherin during mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transition?,Our clinical observations and experimental data indicate that the secondary organ microenvironment can induce the re-expression of E-cadherin and consequently MErT. This phenotypic change is reflected in altered cell behavior and thus may be a critical step in cell survival at metastatic sites.
Is expression of miRNA-106b in conventional renal cell carcinoma a potential marker for prediction of early metastasis after nephrectomy?,"We have confirmed previous observations obtained by miRNA microarray analysis using standardized real-time PCR method. For the first time, we have identified a prognostic significance of miRNA-106b, which, after validation on a larger group of patients, maybe useful as a promising biomarker in patients with RCC."

Do specific protein and miRNA patterns characterise tumour-associated fibroblasts in bladder cancer?,"In summary, we determined proteomic and epigenetic differences between non-tumour fibroblasts and TAF of urinary bladder carcinoma and identified specific protein expression patterns as well as miRNA profiles of TAF in comparison with non-tumour fibroblasts. These findings provide more insights into the complex tumour network and a good starting point for the identification of markers for the prediction of tumour development and progression based on specific TAF expression patterns."
Are large copy-number variations enriched in cases with moderate to extreme obesity?,"Our results suggest that large CNVs, especially rare deletions, confer risk of obesity in patients with moderate obesity and that genes impacted by large CNVs represent intriguing candidates for obesity that warrant further study."
Is sDMA an early marker of change in GFR after living-related kidney donation?,"SDMA might be a valuable and early marker of change in GFR in the clinical and experimental setting. Future studies will have to clarify whether sensitivity, specificity and temporal resolution of SDMA make it an attractive candidate for the assessment of renal function in both the experimental and clinical setting."
Do tLX1 and NOTCH coregulate transcription in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells?,"We found that TLX1 and NOTCH synergistically regulate transcription in T-ALL, at least in part via the sharing of a TLE corepressor and by augmenting expression of MYC. We conclude that the TLX1/NOTCH/MYC network is a central determinant promoting the growth and survival of TLX1+ T-ALL cells. In addition, the TLX1/NOTCH/MYC transcriptional network coregulates genes involved in T cell development, such as CD1 and RAG family members, and therefore may prescribe the early cortical stage of differentiation arrest characteristic of the TLX1 subgroup of T-ALL."
"Is nutritional status related to fat-free mass , exercise capacity and inspiratory strength in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients?","Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who were overweight or obese had a greater FFM, exercise capacity and inspiratory muscle strength than patients with the same degree of airflow obstruction who were of normal weight or underweight, and higher FFM was independently associated with higher exercise capacity. These characteristics of overweight or obese patients might counteract the drawbacks of excess weight and lead to an improved prognosis in COPD."
Does sleep disruption aggravate focal cerebral ischemia in the rat?,These results provide the first direct evidence for a detrimental impact of sleep disruption on stroke evolution and suggest a potential role of sleep modulating treatments on stroke outcomes.
Are anti-Tribbles homolog 2 ( TRIB2 ) autoantibodies in narcolepsy associated with recent onset of cataplexy?,Anti-TRIB2 autoantibodies are strongly associated with narcolepsy close to cataplexy onset (< or = 2.3 years). Anti-TRIB2 was rarely found in cases without cataplexy or with distant onset.
Is atonal homolog 1 required for growth and differentiation effects of notch/gamma-secretase inhibitors on normal and cancerous intestinal epithelial cells?,"ATOH1 is required for all effects of GSIs in intestinal crypts and adenomas; Notch has no unique function in intestinal progenitors and cancer cells other than to regulate ATOH1 expression. Reducing ATOH1 activity might mitigate intestinal toxicity from systemic GSI therapy for nonintestinal diseases. Among gastrointestinal malignancies, ATOH1 mediates the effects of GSIs, so ATOH1 expression levels might predict responses to these inhibitors. We propose that only the subset of CRCs that retain ATOH1 expression will respond to GSIs."
Are serum levels of advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) independent correlates of insulin resistance in nondiabetic subjects?,"The present study demonstrated for the first time that serum AGE levels were one of the independent correlates of HOMA-IR index, thus suggesting that AGEs may play some pathological role in insulin resistance in humans."
Does breastfeeding predict the risk of childhood obesity in a multi-ethnic cohort of women with diabetes?,"Breastfeeding significantly decreased the likelihood of obesity in offspring of mothers with pregestational diabetes, independent of maternal BMI and diabetes type.

Does [ Leukemia inhibitory factor suppress renal interstitial fibroblast activation induced by transforming growth factor ]?,LIF suppresses TGF-beta1-induced activation and collagen I secretion of cultured renal interstitial fibroblasts.
Do structural models of the comorbidity of internalizing disorders and substance use disorders in a longitudinal birth cohort?,"The findings suggest that the comorbidity between internalizing disorders and substance use disorders can be attributed to both common fixed factors and direct causal pathways between substance use disorder and internalizing disorder. The evidence suggests that, in most cases, the most plausible explanation of causality is the one in which substance use disorder increases the risk of internalizing disorder."
Do automated data capture from free-text radiology reports to enhance accuracy of hospital inpatient stroke codes?,"A free-text processing approach was acceptably accurate at identifying IS, but not ICH. This approach could be adapted to other studies where radiology reports may be informative."
Does sexual dimorphism of the zebra finch syrinx indicate adaptation for high fundamental frequencies in males?,"The syringeal modifications in the male syrinx, in concert with dimorphisms in neural control and muscle mass, are most likely the foundation for the potential to generate an enhanced frequency range. Sexually dimorphic vocal behavior therefore arises from finely tuned modifications at every level of the motor cascade. This sexual dimorphism in frequency control illustrates a significant evolutionary step towards increased vocal complexity in birds."
Do low serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate predict all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in elderly Swedish men?,"Low serum levels of DHEA(-S) predict death from all causes, CVD, and ischemic heart disease in older men."
Are outcomes of simultaneous liver/kidney transplants equivalent to kidney transplant alone : a preliminary report?,SLK is a life-saving procedure with excellent patient and graft survival. AMR incidence in the KTx appears reduced in SLK compared with KTA regardless of level of preoperative panel reactive antibody. A high level of donor-specific antibody should not preclude simultaneous transplantation when clinically indicated.

Are clear cells in the atrioventricular valves of infants with severe human mucopolysaccharidosis ( Hurler syndrome ) activated valvular interstitial cells?,"We conclude that ""clear"" or ""Hurler"" cells are valvular interstitial cells with the immunohistochemical phenotype of activated myofibroblasts and may be engaged, albeit ineffectively, in valve repair."
Does robot-assisted gastrojejunal anastomosis improve the results of the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?,"Although safe and intuitive, the robotic approach was burdened by a longer operative time and higher equipment costs. Moreover, it did not seem to provide a real advantage over standard laparoscopy in terms of hospital length of stay and complications rates."
Do [ Clinical application and pathological observation of acellular allogeneic dermal matrix in repairing unstable burn scar ]?,"Acellular allogeneic dermal matrix with autogenous split-thickness skin graft may effectively repair the wound after removing the unstable burn scar, and its structure is similar to that of normal skin."
Does amoxicillin treatment modify the composition of Bifidobacterium species in infant intestinal microbiota?,This study showed that a 7 day amoxicillin treatment did not alter the counts of Bifidobacterium. However amoxicillin can have an impact by changing the microbiota at the species level and decreased the diversity of this population.

Is the Pinus taeda genome characterized by diverse and highly diverged repetitive sequences?,This study indicates that the majority of repeats in the P. taeda genome are 'novel' and will therefore require additional BAC or genomic sequencing for accurate characterization. The pine genome contains a very large number of diverged and probably defunct repetitive elements. This study also provides new evidence that sequencing a pine genome using a WGS approach is a feasible goal.
Is moderate chronic kidney disease in women associated with fracture occurrence independently of osteoporosis?,Moderate CKD is a significant independent predictor of fracture occurrence.
Do marked increase in proton pump inhibitors use in Australia?,"PPI use has increased substantially, not only due to substitution of H2RAs but to expansion in the overall market. Utilisation does not appear to be commensurate with prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) nor with prescribing guidelines for PPIs, with significant financial costs to patients and PBS. This study encourages clinical discussion regarding quality use of these medicines."
Is increase of oxygen consumption during a progressive decrease of ventilatory support lower in patients failing the trial in comparison with those who succeed?,"Patients failing a decremental pressure support trial, in comparison with those who succeed, had an higher baseline oxygen consumption and were not able to increase their oxygen consumption in response to an increased demand."
Does severe traumatic brain injury in children elevate glial fibrillary acidic protein in cerebrospinal fluid and serum?,"GFAP was markedly elevated in cerebrospinal fluid and serum in children after severe TBI and serum GFAP measured on pediatric intensive care unit day 1 correlated with functional outcome at 6 months. Hypothermia therapy did not alter serum GFAP levels compared with normothermia after severe TBI in children. Serum GFAP concentration, together with other biomarkers, may have prognostic value after TBI in children."
Is neglect more common and severe at extreme hemoglobin levels in right hemispheric stroke?,"Lower and higher hemoglobin levels were each associated with increased odds of neglect and with worse severity of neglect, independent of stroke size and severity. Higher hemoglobin values may represent dehydration or hyperviscosity. The importance of the extremes of hemoglobin in identifying individuals at risk for worse functional consequences of stroke warrants further study."

Does beta1-adrenoceptor polymorphism predict flecainide action in patients with atrial fibrillation?,The beta(1)AR Arg389Arg genotype is associated with increased flecainide potency and higher heart rate during atrial fibrillation. The Arg389Gly-Ser49Gly genotype might be of predictive value for atrial fibrillation.
Do why values elicitation techniques enable people to make informed decisions about cancer trial participation?,"Explicit VC techniques are likely to be active ingredients in decision aids. They work by enabling people to deliberate about the decision information in accord with their personal values, which is associated with a better decision experience."
Does magnesium enhance adherence and cartilage formation of synovial mesenchymal stem cells through integrins?,"Magnesium enhanced adherence of synovial MSCs through integrins, which promoted synthesis of cartilage matrix at an early phase."
Is high IL-12 p35 and IL-23 p19 mRNA expression associated with superior outcome in ovarian cancer?,"In contrast to the recently proposed opposing roles of IL-12 and IL-23 for cancer growth and progression in rodents, our data from a large patient cohort rather suggest that high intra-tumoral expression levels of p35 mRNA and p19 mRNA are associated with a superior clinical outcome."
Do chromosome 9p deletions identify an aggressive phenotype of clear cell renal cell carcinoma?,"Deletion of chromosome 9p in ccRCC occurred in 14% of patients and was associated with higher grade and T classification, and the presence of lymph node and distant metastases. In addition, 9p deletion independently conferred a worse prognosis for patients with localized ccRCC, and most noteworthy, in patients with localized, small renal masses. Preoperatively identifying patients with 9p deletions will improve risk stratification and will help to select appropriate patients for surveillance protocols or aggressive treatment."
Is short sleep duration associated with the development of impaired fasting glucose : the Western New York Health Study?,Short sleep duration was associated with an elevated risk of IFG. Insulin resistance appears to mediate this association.
Does expression levels of a kinesin-13 microtubule depolymerase modulate the effectiveness of anti-microtubule agents?,"Our results demonstrate that the efficacy of microtubule destabilization by a pharmacological agent is dependent upon the cellular expression of a microtubule depolymerase. These findings suggest that expression levels of Kif2A, the human kinesin-13 family member, may be an attractive biomarker to assess the effectiveness of anti-microtubule chemotherapies. Knowledge of how MAP expression levels affect the action of anti-microtubule drugs may prove useful for evaluating possible modes of cancer treatment."
Is acetic acid spray an effective tool for the endoscopic detection of neoplasia in patients with Barrett 's esophagus?,"Analysis of this large series showed that acetic acid-assisted evaluation of Barrett's esophagus detects neoplasia better than white light endoscopy, with sensitivity and specificity equal to that of histological analysis."
Does combined exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy improve outcomes in patients with heart failure?,Interventions designed to improve both physical and psychological symptoms may provide the best method for optimizing functioning and enhancing HRQOL in patients with HF.
Is the fruits of ones labor : Effort-reward imbalance but not job strain related to heart rate variability across the day in 35-44-year-old workers?,"The inverse association between work stress as measured by ERI and HRV appears to be most pronounced in workers aged 35-44. These findings may partly be explained by age-dependent HRV declines, age-related differences in career attitudes or increased susceptibility among those aged 35-44 due to facing multiple different stressors at the same time."
Is vascular disease associated with facet joint osteoarthritis?,"AACs were associated with FJ OA in this community-based population, when adjusting for epidemiologic factors associated with spinal degeneration, and cardiovascular risk factors. Potentially modifiable risk factors for facet degeneration unrelated to conventional biomechanical paradigms may exist. This study is limited by cross-sectional design; longitudinal studies are needed."
Does comparative Multi-Epitope-Ligand-Cartography reveal essential immunological alterations in Barrett 's metaplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma?,"Proteomic analysis showed for the first time that proteins, which are critically involved in the mucosal immune system of the esophagus, are distinctly expressed in BE and EAC, whereas others are comparably altered in both diseases, suggesting that many pathogenic events might be shared by both diseases. Topological proteomic analysis, therefore, helps us to understand the different pathogenic events in the underlying disease pathways."
Is the increase in dural sac area maintained at 2 years after X-stop implantation for the treatment of spinal stenosis with no significant alteration in lumbar spine range of movement?,X-stop interspinous device remains effective in decompressing the stenosed spinal segment by increasing the anatomic dural cross-sectional area and foraminal area of spinal canal. It does not significantly alter the ROM of lumbar spine at instrumented and adjacent levels at 24 months postoperatively.
Is the prognosis of chronic low back pain determined by changes in pain and disability in the initial period?,"Clinical-, work-, and psychosocial-related variables contribute to the development of chronic LBP. The most promising variables are a clinically relevant decrease in pain intensity and in disability status in the first 3 months. These variables are relevant for clinicians to advise their patients with respect to preventive measures or treatment strategies."
Do raman profiles of the stratum corneum define 3 filaggrin genotype-determined atopic dermatitis endophenotypes?,Raman spectroscopy permits rapid and highly accurate stratification of FLG-associated AD. FLG mutations do not influence TEWL within established moderate-to-severe AD.
Is aDHD associated with a `` Western '' dietary pattern in adolescents?,A Western-style diet may be associated with ADHD.
Is breast arterial calcification associated with reproductive factors in asymptomatic postmenopausal women?,The presence or absence of BAC at mammography may provide an assessment of a postmenopausal woman's lifetime estrogen exposure and indicate women who could be at risk for hormonally related conditions.
Do tobacco use increase the number of aneuploid nuclei in the clinically healthy oral epithelium?,Tobacco use is responsible for an increased number of aneuploid nuclei in the oral epithelium.
Is socioeconomic status inversely associated with overweight in preschool children?,"The inverse association between socioeconomic status and childhood overweight presumably emerges after age 3 years. Before this age, the gradient may be the reverse."
Does depression strongly influence postconcussion symptom reporting following mild traumatic brain injury?,"Patients who experience MTBIs and who have a postinjury recovery course complicated by significant depression report more postconcussion symptoms, and more severe symptoms, than (a) outpatients with depression, and (b) patients with MTBIs who do not have significant symptoms of depression."
Is ileal disease associated with surgery for perianal disease in a population-based Crohn 's disease cohort?,"PSIs are frequent in patients with Crohn's disease, particularly those with ileal disease and those diagnosed at a young age."
Does cannabis-based treatment induce polarity-reversing plasticity assessed by theta burst stimulation in humans?,"Our results indicate that cannabis ingredients have metaplastic effects on the motor cortex, and strongly suggest that the cannabinoid system is involved in the modulation of synaptic plasticity not only in rodents but also in humans."
Is lipocalin 2 protective against E. coli pneumonia?,Lipocalin 2 is important for protection of airways against infection by E. coli.
Does genome sequence of the necrotrophic plant pathogen Pythium ultimum reveal original pathogenicity mechanisms and effector repertoire?,Access to the P. ultimum genome has revealed not only core pathogenic mechanisms within the oomycetes but also lineage-specific genes associated with the alternative virulence and lifestyles found within the pythiaceous lineages compared to the Peronosporaceae.
"Do benzodiazepines predict use of opioids -- a follow-up study of 17,074 men and women?","Our study suggests that earlier use of benzodiazepines may predict repeated use of opioids. Before starting pain treatment with opioids, clinicians should take into consideration the possibility of substance abuse and mental health disorders. A central issue when prescribing opioids for chronic noncancer pain is to balance the risk of problematic use of these drugs with the benefits of pain relief."
Does intraductal meibomian gland probing relieve symptoms of obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction?,"Invasive orifice penetration and intraductal probing seems to provide lasting rapid symptom relief for patients with O-MGD. Probing findings in this study frequently included (1) mild resistance upon orifice penetration, (2) proximal duct gritty tactile and aural sensation suggestive of keratinized cellular debris, and (3) focal variable resistance deeper within the duct, which may be relieved with the probe, suggestive of fibrovascular tissue. Taken together, these findings may offer probing characteristics that may allow for a grading system for duct obstruction. The postprobing improvement of symptoms not previously appreciated supports the notion that meibomian gland disease exists subclinically."
Does motesanib inhibit Kit mutations associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors?,"In conclusion, our data suggest that motesanib possesses inhibitory activity against primary Kit mutations and some imatinib-resistant secondary mutations."
Is salivary amylase activity useful for assessing perioperative stress in response to pain in patients undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection of gastric tumors under deep sedation?,"Sympathetic agitation, expressed as an increase of sAMY, was absent in the GA group. Meanwhile, in the DS group, some patients showed high levels of sAMY which went down following the administration of an analgesic agent, thus suggesting that pain caused an elevation in the level of the stress and thereby induced an increase in sAMY. The measurement of sAMY is therefore considered to be useful for the assessment of analgesic status under DS."
Is serum matrix-metalloproteinase-1 a bona fide prognostic marker for colorectal cancer?,"Within the MMP family of proteins, MMP-1 is not a cancer-specific protease. However, MMP-1 activity does predict the future course of progression of malignant cells. Thus, MMP-1, which is activated at the primary lesion and is found in serum, assists in the clinical diagnosis of CRC. It is also an important molecule for understanding the underlying mechanism of invasion and metastasis of CRC."
Does estrogen treatment impair cognitive performance after psychosocial stress and monoamine depletion in postmenopausal women?,These data suggest that the relationship between estrogen administration and cognitive/behavioral performance in postmenopausal women may be more complex than initially appreciated and that the effects of psychosocial stress may influence whether hormone effects are beneficial.
Does a biology-driven approach identify the hypoxia gene signature as a predictor of the outcome of neuroblastoma patients?,Our results demonstrate that the NB-hypo is a novel and independent prognostic factor for neuroblastoma and support the view that hypoxia is negatively correlated with tumors' outcome. We show the power of the biology-driven approach in defining hypoxia as a critical molecular program in neuroblastoma and the potential for improvement in the current criteria for risk stratification.
Does high prevalence of goiter in schoolchildren in Isfahan ; zinc deficiency play a role?,The prevalence of goiter is still high in Isfahan schoolchildren. It seems that zinc status is not involved in the high prevalence of goiter in this region. The role of other possible goitrogens should be investigated in Isfahan.
Is rapid endoscopic improvement important for 1-year avoidance of colectomy but not for the long-term prognosis in cyclosporine A treatment for ulcerative colitis?,"Although CSA can exert high initial efficacy for severe attacks of UC, >50% of patients who relapse require a colectomy. Specifically, mucosal healing evaluated by endoscopy was associated with the 1-year colectomy rate. In contrast, a history of adverse drug reactions was correlated with the long-term colectomy rate. Therefore, we propose that treatment of severe UC with CSA requires consideration of both initial remission and long-term maintenance as management goals."
Are genomic alterations and allelic imbalances strong prognostic predictors in osteosarcoma?,Structural chromosomal alterations detected by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis provide a simple but robust parameter to anticipate response to chemotherapy. The proposed chromosomal alteration staging system might therefore help to better predict the clinical course of osteosarcoma patients at the time of initial diagnosis and to adapt neoadjuvant treatment in patients resistant to the current protocols.
Are proximal and large hyperplastic and nondysplastic serrated polyps detected by colonoscopy associated with neoplasia?,Detection of proximal and large ND-SP at a screening colonoscopy is associated with an increased risk for synchronous advanced neoplasia. Detection of proximal ND-SP in a baseline colonoscopy is associated with an increased risk for interval neoplasia during surveillance.
Is overweight in midlife related to lower cognitive function 30 years later : a prospective study with longitudinal assessments?,"Our results indicate that midlife overweight is related to lower overall cognitive function in old age. The fact that BMI-related effects were noted in mean-level cognitive performance, whereas only one ability showed differences in slopes, suggests that the negative effect of overweight has an onset before the entry into very old age."
Are single nucleotide polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes associated with venous thromboembolism?,"Four SNPs in inflammatory-related genes of IL1A, IL4, IL6, and IL13 may be associated with VTE. These results need to be confirmed in independent groups with larger number of patients."
Is milk of northern Sudanese mothers whose traditional diet high in carbohydrate contains low docosahexaenoic acid?,"  The study reveals breast milk of NSW, whose traditional diet is almost devoid of fish and fish products, is unlikely to provide sufficient DHA to support optimal postnatal neuro-visual development."
Are anxiety and depressive symptoms in fibromyalgia related to poor perception of health but not to pain sensitivity or cerebral processing of pain?,Negative mood in FM patients can lead to a poor perception of one's physical health (and vice versa) but does not influence performance on assessments of clinical and experimental pain. Our data provide evidence that 2 partially segregated mechanisms are involved in the neural processing of experimental pain and negative affect.
Is endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy required for transpapillary SEMS placement for biliary obstruction?,"Patients who undergo biliary sphincterotomy during transpapillary self-expanding metal stent placement experience more immediate complications than those who do not. Biliary sphincterotomy was not associated with longer stent patency. Self-expanding metal stent placement without a biliary sphincterotomy was not associated with pancreatitis regardless of the type of self-expanding metal stent used (covered or uncovered). Of the patients without a biliary sphincterotomy, 100% had successful stent placement, further arguing against its use in this setting."
Does mineralocorticoid accelerate transition to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction via `` nongenomic effects ''?,"Pressure-overload hypertrophy sensitizes the heart to mineralocorticoid excess, which promotes the transition to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction independently of classic mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent gene transcription."
Is cD74 a survival receptor on colon epithelial cells?,CD74 is expressed on CEC and colon carcinoma cells and serves as a survival receptor in these cells. These results may have implications on colorectal cancer research.
Is histologic diagnosis based on forceps biopsy adequate for determining endoscopic treatment of gastric adenomatous lesions?,We should consider endoscopic resection for gastric LGD that are 2 cm or more in size and do not have whitish discoloration.
Is cerebral reserve decreased in elderly patients with carotid stenosis?,"Age >or=70 is associated with poor cerebral reserve in patients with significant carotid stenosis as measured by CBF response to an ACZ challenge. Thus, patients >or=70 may be more sensitive to minor cerebral emboli, which may be one factor explaining their higher risk of stroke during CAS."
Does nocturnal hypoxia exposure with simulated altitude for 14 days significantly alter working memory or vigilance in humans?,Two weeks of nocturnal continuous hypoxia in an altitude tent did not induce subjective sleepiness or impair objective vigilance and working memory. Caution is recommended in the extrapolation to humans the effects of hypoxia in animal models.
Does the Candida glabrata putative sterol transporter gene CgAUS1 protect cells against azoles in the presence of serum?,CgAUS1 appears to function as a sterol transporter that may contribute to lower azole susceptibility in the presence of serum and to protect C. glabrata against azole toxicity in vivo.
Does future time orientation predict academic engagement among first-year university students?,"Future orientation emerged as an important factor mediating students' academic engagement in these students who completed one semester of study. Interventions focusing on the development of time perspective may be helpful in encouraging and supporting academic engagement and, ultimately, persistence in higher education."
Are phyllodes tumor of the breast : stromal overgrowth and histological classification useful prognosis-predictive factors for local recurrence in patients with a positive surgical margin?,Wide excision is the preferred therapy for phyllodes tumor and preoperative diagnosis is important for good local control. Re-excision is recommended in cases with a positive surgical margin and stromal overgrowth and malignancy.
Does impact of clinical alert within an electronic health record on routine childhood immunization in an urban pediatric population?,"An electronic health record-based clinical alert intervention was associated with increases in captured opportunities for vaccination at both sick and well visits and significant improvements in immunization rates at 2 years of age. As electronic health records become more common in medical practice, such systems may transform immunization delivery to children."
Does pulmonary vein isolation predict freedom from arrhythmia after circumferential antral ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation?,Circumferential antral ablation achieves bidirectional isolation in 80% of PVs. Bidirectional isolation of all PVs is essential to curing patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Does microRNA expression profiling of human breast cancer identify new markers of tumor subtype?,"This study represents the first integrated analysis of miRNA expression, mRNA expression and genomic changes in human breast cancer and may serve as a basis for functional studies of the role of miRNAs in the etiology of breast cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bead-based flow cytometric miRNA expression profiling might be a suitable platform to classify breast cancer into prognostic molecular subtypes."
Do genetic variants in cell cycle control pathway confer susceptibility to lung cancer?,Our results suggest that cell cycle gene polymorphisms and smoking may function collectively to modulate the risk of lung cancer.
Is histologic inflammation a risk factor for progression to colorectal neoplasia in ulcerative colitis : a cohort study?,The severity of microscopic inflammation over time is an independent risk factor for developing advanced colorectal neoplasia among patients with long-standing UC.
Is l1 associated with favorable outcome in neuroblastomas in contrast to adult tumors?,"In contrast to adult tumor entities, where L1 is associated with aggressive clinical behavior, our data show that L1 predicts good outcome in children with neuroblastoma. This novel finding suggests an inverse role of L1 in neuroblastoma. Future studies might focus on the molecular basis of the varying effect of L1 in different tumors."
Does real-world replication of randomized controlled trial result for carotid endarterectomy?,"This large population-based study shows that the RCT results for CE can be achieved in the real world. However, the finding that some hospitals exceeded the maximum suggested rates of adverse events highlights the need for continuous outcome monitoring and associated quality improvement efforts to ensure that all providers and institutions involved achieve desired outcomes."
Are behavioural and psychological symptoms related to white matter hyperintensities and medial temporal lobe atrophy in Alzheimer 's disease?,"There were no differences in prevalence of behavioural and psychological symptoms according to MTA or WMH, as rated on MRI. This suggests that the occurrence of those symptoms depends on other determinants, such as coping style or genetic make-up."
Is milk consumption during pregnancy associated with increased infant size at birth : prospective cohort study?,"Milk intake in pregnancy was associated with higher birth weight for gestational age, lower risk of SGA, and higher risk of LGA."
Do medications necessarily normalize cognition in ADHD patients?,"Even with optimal treatment, based on parents' and teachers' opinions, subtle and not-so-subtle neurocognitive impairments persisted in the ADHD patients. Some ADHD patients may require additional educational assistance, even in the face of successful medication treatment."
Are perioperative neurological complications after liver transplantation best predicted by pre-transplant hepatic encephalopathy?,"Neurological events, manifesting most often as encephalopathy, occurred in almost one-third of patients after LT. Those suffering from HE at the time of LT may be more vulnerable to the metabolic stresses of surgery and the neurotoxicity of the drugs used, and were at highest risk for such complications."
Are multiple superoxide dismutase 1/splicing factor serine alanine 15 variants associated with the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy : the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Genetics study?,Multiple variations in SOD1 are significantly associated with persistent microalbuminuria and severe nephropathy in the DCCT/EDIC study.
Does the reduced Impact of Psoriasis Questionnaire have good psychometric properties in Italian patients?,The 11-item IPSO is a valuable psoriasis-specific HRQOL instrument in different populations.
Does a high tumor-associated macrophage content predict favorable outcome in follicular lymphoma patients treated with rituximab and cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone?,The data suggest that high TAM score is associated with a favorable prognosis in FL patients treated with immunochemotherapy.
Does chest pain on exercise treadmill test predict future cardiac hospitalizations?,"Chest pain during ETT, even without ECG changes, predicts subsequent cardiac hospitalizations. Future studies should evaluate whether aggressive management of such patients can prevent subsequent hospitalizations."
Do biomechanical signals inhibit IKK activity to attenuate NF-kappaB transcription activity in inflamed chondrocytes?,"These results indicate that the signals generated by cyclic tensile strain act at multiple sites within the NF-kappaB signaling cascade to inhibit IL-1beta-induced proinflammatory gene induction. Taken together, these findings provide insight into how biomechanical signals regulate and reduce inflammation, and underscore their potential in enhancing the ability of chondrocytes to curb inflammation in diseased joints."
Do pharmacogenomic strategies provide a rational approach to the treatment of cisplatin-resistant patients with advanced cancer?,The use of genomic predictors of response to cisplatin and pemetrexed can be incorporated into strategies to optimize therapy for advanced solid tumors.
Does molecular analysis of a leprosy immunotherapeutic bacillus provide insights into Mycobacterium evolution?,This evolutionary paradigm possibly affirms to marshall our understanding about the acquisition and optimization of virulence in mycobacteria and determinants of boundaries therein.
Is expression of estrogen receptor beta wild-type and its variant ERbetacx/beta2 correlated with better prognosis in breast cancer?,"Our results indicate that ERbetacx/beta2 mRNA expression is an independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. ERbeta expression status, both wild-type and the variant cx/beta2, might represent significant predictors of breast cancer prognosis."
Is proportion of individuals with low serum vitamin B-12 concentrations without macrocytosis higher in the post folic acid fortification period than in the pre folic acid fortification period?,Subjects with low serum vitamin B-12 were likely to be without macrocytosis in the postfortification period. MCV should not be used as a marker for vitamin B-12 insufficiency. It is possible that folic acid fortification may have led to a correction of macrocytosis associated with vitamin B-12 insufficiency.
Is metabolic syndrome associated with severe fibrosis in chronic viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis?,"Metabolic syndrome is more prevalent in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis than in chronic viral hepatitis; it is associated independently with more severe fibrosis but not with the severity of steatosis, both in chronic viral hepatitis and in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis."
"Are severe symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease associated with cardiovascular disease and other gastrointestinal symptoms , but not diabetes : a population-based study?","This population-based study indicates that myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke and symptoms of nausea, diarrhoea and constipation are associated with GERD."
Is fetal abdominal subcutaneous tissue thickness measured by ultrasound at term associated with birth weight and mode of delivery?,"In normal pregnancies, FASTT at term is positively associated with birth weight. With increasing FASTT the likelihood of operative vaginal and cesarean delivery increases. FASTT is not associated with perinatal outcome."
Is hypoplastic left heart syndrome heritable?,The high heritability of HLHS suggests that it is determined largely by genetic factors. The frequent occurrence of left- and right-sided valve dysplasia in HLHS probands and the increased prevalence of BAV in family members suggests that HLHS is a severe form of valve malformation.
Do prostate cancer cells tolerate a narrow range of androgen receptor expression and activity?,"CaP cells expressing endogenous AR are sensitive to both increases and decreases in AR expression levels and activity. AR in CaP cells is delicately regulated to provide a balance between cell death and continued proliferation. Thus, both approaches, inhibition and over-stimulation of AR activity, may have therapeutic value for treatment of prostate cancer."
Does hepatic venous pressure gradient correlate with the presence and the severity of portal hypertensive gastropathy in patients with liver cirrhosis?,"Our data show that PHG does not correlate with the degree of portal pressure, and that the prevalence and the severity of this condition are not influenced by the severity of underlying liver disease or by the size of varices."
Do age and distal colonic findings determine the yield of advanced proximal neoplasia in Chinese patients with rectal bleeding?,Colonoscopy should be considered for Chinese patients with rectal bleeding who are aged > or =35 years or those aged <35 years who have adenoma in the distal colon.
Does laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication effectively relieve symptoms in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux?,Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is effective in relieving the symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reflux in a carefully selected patient population. Benefits are seen within 1 month of surgery and persist for at least 3 years.

Are whole brain and localized magnetization transfer measurements associated with cognitive impairment in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus?,"Quantitative MTR measurements, determined for the whole brain and for vulnerable ROIs, are sensitive to neuropathologic changes associated with cognitive impairment in HIV-infected patients."
Is angiotensin II type 1 receptor inhibition associated with reduced tachyarrhythmia-induced ventricular interstitial fibrosis in a goat atrial fibrillation model?,Our study demonstrated a beneficial effect of angiotensin II inhibition on tachyarrhythmia-induced ventricular fibrosis. It is also consistent with previous studies indicating a reduction in burst-induced AF susceptibility in goats and confirms the favorable effects in atrial structural remodeling.
Does evolutionary distance from human homologs reflect allergenicity of animal food proteins?,"These data support the premise that certain protein structures are more allergenic than others. Contrasting with plant food allergens, animal allergens, such as the highly conserved tropomyosins, challenge the capability of the human immune system to discriminate between foreign and self-proteins. Such immune responses run close to becoming autoimmune responses."
Is human papillomavirus-16 the predominant type etiologically involved in penile squamous cell carcinoma?,"HPV16 is the main HPV type etiologically involved in the development of penile SCC. Although individuals who develop penile SCC show a greater prior exposure to a broad spectrum of HPV types, insufficient evidence was found to claim a role for HPV types other than HPV16 in penile carcinogenesis."
Does actual 10-year survival after resection of colorectal liver metastases define cure?,"Patients who survive 10 years appear to be cured of their disease, whereas approximately one third of actual 5-year survivors succumb to a cancer-related death. In well-selected patients, there is at least a one in six chance of cure after hepatectomy for CLM. The presence of poor prognostic factors does not preclude the possibility of long-term survival and cure."
Is chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps associated with decreased expression of mucosal interleukin 22 receptor?,"In this study, we demonstrate IL-22R1 mRNA and protein expression on nasal epithelial cells. Failure of medical and surgical therapy in CRSwNP is associated with significantly decreased expression of IL-22R1. Further research is needed to determine the potential of IL-22R1 as a therapeutic target in CRSwNP."
Does neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer determined by chemosensitivity assay achieve better tumor response?,"It is a useful in vitro assay to provide a reference of the particular patient who received treatment according to her sensitivity result. It may improve pathologic complete response, clinical tumor response and lead to less extensive surgery."
Do both postnatal and postmenstrual age contribute to the interindividual variability in tramadol glucuronidation in neonates?,"Besides PMA, there is an additional, independent impact of PNA since phenotypic glucuronidation activity is significantly lower in the first week of postnatal life. These findings should be taken into account in the assessment of compounds for whom glucuronidation is of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic or toxicological relevance."
Does androgen-induced masculinization in rainbow trout result in a marked dysregulation of early gonadal gene expression profiles?,"This study provides evidence that androgen masculinization results in a marked dysregulation of early gene expression profiles when compared to natural testicular or ovarian differentiation. Based on these results we suggest that, in our experimental conditions, androgen masculinization proceeds mainly through an early inhibition of female development."
Does partial inhibition of integrin alpha ( v ) beta6 prevent pulmonary fibrosis without exacerbating inflammation?,"Partial inhibition of TGF-beta using alpha(v)beta6 integrin antibodies is effective in blocking murine pulmonary fibrosis without exacerbating inflammation. In addition, the elevated expression of alpha(v)beta6, an activator of the fibrogenic cytokine, TGF-beta, in human pulmonary fibrosis suggests that alpha(v)beta6 monoclonal antibodies could represent a promising new therapeutic strategy for treating pulmonary fibrosis."
Does insulin pump therapy with continuous glucose monitoring improve metabolic control in brittle type 1 diabetes?,"Insulin pump therapy can be initiated and used effectively in brittle type 1 diabetics to improve metabolic control and quality-of-life. When diabetes and pump management are appropriately individualized, this kind of therapy can help type 1 diabetics to achieve and to sustain metabolic control. Lifestyle flexibility, quality-of-life improvement, and independence can be maintained throughout young adulthood."
Are sp3 and sp4 transcription factor levels increased in brains of patients with Alzheimer 's disease?,Our data evidence Sp3 and Sp4 as new hallmarks of AD in postmortem human brains and further point out that Sp proteins are potential triggers of neuronal death signaling cascades.
Does the amygdala regulate the antianxiety sensitization effect of flumazenil during repeated chronic ethanol or repeated stress?,"Intra-amygdala flumazenil inhibits the development of anxiety sensitized by repeated ethanol withdrawal, stress/ethanol withdrawal, or DMCM/ethanol withdrawal. These actions suggest that site-specific and persistent effects of flumazenil on gamma-aminobutyric acid-modulatory processes in this brain region are relevant to sensitized behavioral effects seen in alcoholism."
Are pediatric spinal injury type and severity age and mechanism dependent?,"This study has shown that the pattern of spinal injury in children is related to age and also the mechanism of injury. While traffic-related incidents are a leading cause of injury across all age groups, emphasis on fall prevention is needed for younger children. Older children, particularly boys, are sustaining spinal trauma in sporting and recreational activities."
Do statin-treated familial hypercholesterolemia patients with coronary heart disease and pronounced atherosclerosis have more brain lesions than healthy controls in later middle age?,"FH patients with CHD and adequate cardiovascular risk-factor treatment showed no difference in the amount or size of clinically silent brain lesions compared to controls, despite patients' more severe atherosclerosis."
Does tIMI risk score underestimate prognosis in unstable angina/non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction?,TIMI risk score is of limited value for individual risk stratification. The presence of positive cardiac markers (troponin) appears to be a more powerful prognostic marker.
Does e2F-1 overexpression correlate with decreased proliferation and better prognosis in adenocarcinomas of Barrett oesophagus?,"E2F-1 expression was negatively related to tumour proliferation in ACs of Barrett oesophagus. Additionally, E2F-1 immunohistochemical status correlated positively with patient survival. These findings are opposite from those seen in OSCCs, suggesting that the tumour-suppressing E2F-1 behaviour in oesophageal adenocarcinomas is possibly due to the intestinal-type nature of the metaplastic Barrett mucosa."
"Is prognostic significance of the non-size-based AJCC T2 descriptors : visceral pleura invasion , hilar atelectasis , or obstructive pneumonitis in stage IB non-small cell lung cancer dependent on tumor size?",Prognostic significance of the non-size-based T2 descriptor T2P is dependent on tumor size.
Are apathy and depression in Alzheimer 's disease associated with functional deficit and psychotropic prescription?,"Some negative neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy and depression have a specific relation with functional and therapeutic outcomes of AD, independently from cognitive status. Further studies are needed to establish if apathy represents a particularly severe phenotype of AD."
Do global histone modifications predict prognosis of resected non small-cell lung cancer?,"The prognostic influence of epigenetic changes involving multiple histones, in particular H2A and H3, is greater in early NSCLC, and evaluation of these changes may help in selecting early-stage NSCLC patients for adjuvant treatment. Our observations provide a rationale for the use of a combination of standard chemotherapy with drugs interacting with histone modifications, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors."
Does low-dose sufentanil potentiate intrathecal morphine for perioperative analgesia after major colorectal surgery?,"These results do not support the addition of 10 microg ITS to 0.4 mg ITM for colorectal surgery, as low dose sufentanil does not improve intraoperative and postoperative analgesia in this setting."
Does increased polycomb-group oncogene Bmi-1 expression correlate with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma?,Our study indicated that Bmi-1 could be a candidate biomarker for long-term survival in HCC.
Is birth weight lower for survivors of the vanishing twin syndrome : a case-control study?,"A higher risk for lower birth weight and being small for gestational age for survivors of the vanishing twin syndrome was found. Such pregnancies need to be carefully monitored, and parents must be informed about the associated risks when transferring more than one embryo."
Are endothelial dysfunction and C-reactive protein risk factors for diabetes in essential hypertension?,An impaired vasodilatory response to acetylcholine predicts development of type 2 diabetes in patients with essential hypertension. Present data also extend recent findings regarding a possible inflammatory pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and suggest a new approach in treatment of essential hypertension.
Is pelvic tenderness limited to the prostate in chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome ( CPPS ) type IIIA and IIIB : comparison of men with and without CP/CPPS?,Men with CP/CPPS have more tenderness compared to men without CPPS. Tenderness in men with CPPS is distributed throughout the pelvis and not specific to the prostate.
Does agmatine protect retinal ganglion cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis in transformed rat retinal ganglion cell line?,Our results show that agmatine has neuroprotective effects against hypoxia-induced retinal ganglion cell damage in RGC-5 cells and that its effects may act through the JNK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Our data suggest that agmatine may lead to a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce retinal ganglion cell injury related to hypoxia.
Does a nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ameliorate pulmonary hypertension in rats?,"We concluded that the NF-kappaB nuclear localization and VCAM-1 expression is temporally and spatially associated with the development of MCT-induced PH in rats, which was ameliorated by administering a NF-kappaB inhibitor, PDTC."
Does postoperative prostate-specific antigen velocity independently predict for failure of salvage radiotherapy after prostatectomy?,"Postoperative PSA velocity independently predicts for the failure of salvage RT and can be considered in addition to high-risk features when selecting patients in need of systemic therapy following biochemical failure after RP. For well-selected patients, salvage RT can achieve high cure rates."
Does the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor vildagliptin improve beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in subjects with impaired fasting glucose?,"The DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin improves insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function, leading to improved postprandial glycemia in subjects with IFG, who are known to have beta-cell dysfunction. Thus, vildagliptin may prevent progression to diabetes in high-risk subjects."
Are somatic symptoms and diseases more common in women exposed to violence?,"Violence was associated with the presence of somatic symptoms and diseases. The more a woman is exposed to violence, the higher the number of somatic symptoms and diseases reported is."

Are rBM6-RBM5 transcription-induced chimeras differentially expressed in tumours?,"These results suggest that RBM6 mRNA experiences altered co-transcriptional gene regulation in certain cancers. The results also suggest that RBM6-RBM5 transcription-induced chimerism might be a process that is linked to the tumour-associated increased transcriptional activity of the RBM6 gene. It appears that none of the transcription-induced chimeras generates a protein product; however, the novel alternative splicing, which affects putative functional domains within exons 3, 6 and 11 of RBM6, does suggest that the generation of these chimeric transcripts has functional relevance. Finally, the association of chimeric expression with breast tumour size suggests that RBM6-RBM5 chimeric expression may be a potential tumour differentiation marker."

Many of the genes associated with these regions represent likely novel oncogenes or tumor suppressors."
Is amyloid beta deposition related to decreased glucose transporter-1 levels and hippocampal atrophy in brains of aged APP/PS1 mice?,"We conclude that the GLUT-1 amount and capillary density in both wild type and transgenic mice decrease due to ageing. Further, a decreased amount of GLUT-1 is caused by decreased GLUT-1 amount/capillary density and not due to a reduced capillary density. We suggest that Abeta load in the hippocampus precedes the reduction of GLUT-1. A certain level of Abeta must be reached in the hippocampus, before it affects GLUT-1 amount/capillary density leading to further impairment of energy metabolism and hippocampal atrophy."

The mechanism of GM/WM differentiation loss could be explained by the lack of oxygen caused by ischemia initially affecting the mitochondrial system."
Does fTY720-Induced Lymphopenia Aggravate Mortality in a Murine Model of Polymicrobial Abdominal Sepsis?,Our data demonstrate that inhibition of T cell migration and induction of peripheral lymphopenia did not affect survival in a model of severe murine sepsis. The presence of reduced T- and B-cell numbers in the peripheral blood during a septic challenge did not negatively affect sepsis mortality in our model of severe abdominal sepsis. The absence of increased mortality under FTY720 treatment in the CASP model suggests that FTY720 treatment will probably not result in increased mortality in MS patients suffering from sepsis.
Are many Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Immune to Measles or Pertussis?,"A significant number of our IBD patients lack immunity to measles, and a majority of our IBD patients do not have detectable immunity to pertussis. Importantly, the majority of the measles non-immune patients are on ISS therapy and therefore unable to receive a booster."

Is nutritional Status in Short Stature Children Related to Both Ghrelin and Insulin-like Growth Factor I Concentrations?,"In short, thin children, despite elevated ghrelin production, the low IGF-I concentration is observed, probably due to undernutrition and worse IGF-I formation. In short, normal weight children and in short, obese ones, ghrelin and IGF-I production is normal and it seems that mechanisms responsible for their short stature are other than low IGF-I."
Is food image-induced brain activation diminished by insulin infusion?,"Our data demonstrate that visual food cues induce a strong response in motivation/reward and cognitive-executive control brain regions in non-obese subjects, but that these responses are not diminished by hyperinsulinemia per se. These findings suggest that our modern food cue saturated environment may be sufficient to overpower homeostatic hormonal signals, and thus contribute to the current obesity epidemic."
Are more-than-minimal-trauma fractures associated with low bone density : an 8-year prospective study?,"Men and women over 50 years with a more-than-minimal-trauma fracture, especially those with low body weight, prior minimal trauma fracture or an osteoporosis-associated condition, should be investigated to exclude low bone density and its associated risk of subsequent fractures."

Do signaling cascades transmit information downstream and upstream but unlikely simultaneously?,"The values of biochemical parameters such as kinetic rates, Michaelis-Menten constants, total concentrations of kinases and of phosphatases, determine the propensity of a cascade to favor or impede downstream or upstream signal transmission. We found that generally there is an opposition between parameter sets favoring forward and retro-signaling regimes. Therefore, on one hand our study supports the idea that in most cases, retroactive effects can be neglected when a cascade which is efficient in forward signaling, is perturbed by an external ligand inhibiting the activation at some tier of the cascade. This result is relevant for therapeutic methodologies based on kinase inhibition. On the other hand, our study highlights a less-known part of the parameter space where, although the forward signaling is inefficient, the cascade can interestingly act as a retro-signaling device."

Does telehealthcare for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Switzerland be Feasible and Appreciated by Patients?,"Adding THC to state-of-the-art COPD management is feasible in a selected subgroup of patients. We estimate that up to 50% of COPD patients could be eligible for a THC strategy. Patient compliance, acceptance and satisfaction were very high. With the proposed approach, we missed only very few AECOPD events. However, a telephone-based verification of THC alerts was required. Overall, in this proof-of-concept study, we experienced a positive effort-to-benefit ratio."
Does neurocognitive function vary by IDH1 genetic mutation status in patients with malignant glioma prior to surgical resection?,"Patients with IDH1-WT show reduced NCF compared with those with IDH1-M malignant gliomas. Lesion volume is inversely associated with NCF for patients with IDH1-WT, but not IDH1-M tumors. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that patients with IDH1-WT tumors present with more severe NCF impairment due to greater lesion momentum, which may impede compensatory neuroplasticity and cerebral reorganization."

Does the brain-tumor related protein podoplanin regulate synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory?,"This work proposes podoplanin as a novel component of the neuronal machinery underlying neuritogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and hippocampus-dependent memory functions. The existence of a relevant cross-talk between podoplanin and the NGF/TrkA signaling pathway is also for the first time proposed here, thus providing a novel molecular complex as a target for future multidisciplinary studies of the brain function in the physiology and the pathology. Key messages Podoplanin, a protein linked to the promotion of human brain tumors, is required in vivo for proper hippocampus-dependent learning and memory functions. Deletion of podoplanin selectively impairs activity-dependent synaptic strengthening at the neurogenic dentate-gyrus and hampers neuritogenesis and phospho Ezrin, TrkA and CREB protein levels upon NGF stimulation. Surface plasmon resonance data indicates a physical interaction between podoplanin and NGF. On these grounds, a relevant cross-talk between podoplanin and NGF as well as a role for podoplanin in plasticity-related brain neuronal functions is here proposed."
Does faster rate of blood volume change in pediatric hemodialysis patients impair cardiac index?,The cardiac index and stroke volume decreased significantly during the HD session. Patients with larger blood volume changes during the first 2 h of HD and at 4 h showed a significant decrease in cardiac index that did not recover at the completion of the HD treatment. Rate of fluid removal was the only significant risk factor for compromised cardiac index during HD. Conventional methods currently used for assisting fluid removal in HD are inadequate to assess hemodynamic changes.

These results suggest that nicotinamide, which has been used in humans for the treatment of diabetes and bullous pemphigoid, may hold promise as a preventive therapy of FAS."
Does a high fat/high carbohydrate diet induce aortic valve disease in C57BL/6J mice?,"A HF/HC diet in mice results in significant aortic valve abnormalities. Putting WT mice on a HF/HC diet reproduced a combination of atherogenic factors (obesity, mild dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia) more commonly encountered in humans than isolated severe hypercholesterolemia. Severe hypercholesterolemia was not a prerequisite in our model. This experimental model suggests that AS development is multifactorial and that hypercholesterolemia should not be the only target in this disease."

The 5' ends of antisense strands of efficient siRNAs are U-rich and possess a content similarity to the pyrimidine-rich oligonucleotides interacting with the polypurine RNA tracks that are recognized by RNase H. The advantage of our method over similar methods is the small number of parameters. As a result, our method requires a much smaller training set to produce consistent results. Other mRNA features, though expensive to compute, can slightly improve our model."
Does memantine protect neurons from shrinkage in the lateral geniculate nucleus in experimental glaucoma?,Monkeys with glaucoma that were treated with memantine showed significantly less neuron shrinkage in the lateral geniculate nucleus than the vehicle-treated glaucoma group.
Is depression the main determinant of quality of life in multiple sclerosis : a classification-regression ( CART ) study?,"Results confirm previous findings showing that in patients with multiple sclerosis quality of life is heavily determined by person's mood, whatever his/her neurological or functional severity.

Does selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors prevent emotional lability in healthy subjects?,"(1) In healthy subjects EL is often embarrassing; the possibility is interesting of preventing it on selected occasions with a brief treatment with no side effects and a cheap cost. (2) SSRI are among the most used drugs in the word and every day they are assumed by millions of people including politicians, business man, soldiers, army commanders, policemen and criminals. The idea is very stimulating and highly worrying that the control of the emotions and behaviour of these million of people can be quickly modified by the assumption of one pill of SSRI for a few days or by its discontinuation."
Does tumor antigen expression in melanoma vary according to antigen and stage?,This large series describes patterns of antigen expression in melanoma and their evolution over time. This will help inform decisions about selection of patients and target antigens for melanoma immunotherapy clinical trials.
Does erythropoietin enhance neurological recovery after experimental spinal cord injury?,These findings suggest that erythropoietin enhances neurological recovery following spinal cord injury and it seems to be more effective than methylprednisolone at the given doses.
Are sleep loss and REM sleep loss hyperalgesic?,These studies showed that the loss of 4 hours of sleep and specific REM sleep loss are hyperalgesic the following day. These findings imply that pharmacologic treatments and clinical conditions that reduce sleep and REM sleep time may increase pain.
Do auditory responses in cochlear implant users with and without GJB2 deafness?,"Results suggest more consistent spiral ganglion survival along the length of the cochlea in GJB2-related HL as compared with non-GJB2-related HL, which appears to involve a decreasing gradient of spiral ganglion survival from the apex to the base of the cochlea. Our findings support our premise that in GJB2-related HL, dysfunction of gap junctions likely occurs to a similar degree in the apical and basal regions of the cochlea. This knowledge might be used to customize implantable devices for patients with HL in the future."
Does mycophenolate mofetil as first-line treatment improve clinically evident early scleroderma lung disease?,"Our preliminary data suggest that in patients with dSSc and recent, clinically apparent alveolitis, early treatment with MMF and small doses of corticosteroids (CS) may represent an effective, well-tolerated and safe alternative therapy."
Is velamentous cord insertion into the lower third of the uterus associated with intrapartum fetal heart rate abnormalities?,We have demonstrated that VCI with a lower CI site and with longer aberrant vessels is associated with various intrapartum complications. This finding has the potential for improving perinatal outcome.

Does socioeconomic lifecourse influence on women 's smoking status in early adulthood?,"Both the conventionally measured socioeconomic lifecourse and the domestic lifecourse contributed separately to the odds of smoking and former smoking, suggesting that lifecourse analyses should incorporate women's domestic circumstances as an important pathway of influence on their smoking status in early adulthood."
Is duration of illness an important variable for untreated children with juvenile dermatomyositis?,Duration of untreated symptoms is an important variable and should be included in decisions concerning both diagnostic criteria and intensity of therapy for children with JDM.
Are the prostate-specific G-protein coupled receptors PSGR and PSGR2 prostate cancer biomarkers that are complementary to alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase?,"All three biomarkers are increased in prostate cancer but their expression is not completely concordant. There is a subset of cases in which analysis of expression of PSGR and/or PSGR2, in addition to AMACR, would be diagnostically useful."
Do postprostatectomy target-normal structure overlap volume differences using computed tomography and radioimmunoscintigraphy images for radiotherapy treatment planning?,"On RIS images, there appear to be areas of uptake in the bladder, rectum, and pubic symphysis but not the penile bulb; however, the dosimetric consequences of this uptake for radiation treatment planning are minimal on the bladder, rectum, and penile bulb, but require segmentation for dose reduction to the pubic symphysis."

Patchy atrophy and lacquer cracks were shown to be important predisposing findings for CNV development.
Does reproducibility of functional MR imaging result using two different MR systems?,The location of activated voxels from visual functional MR imaging experiments varied more between sessions on one MR system than on other MR system. The amount of the activated voxels is independent of the MR system used. We suggest that sites performing functional MR imaging for presurgical planning measure the intersession reproducibility to determine an accurate surgical safety margin.
Does a transient dominance of theta event-related brain potential component characterize stimulus processing in an auditory oddball task?,"These results reveal a new neuroelectric correlate of stimulus processing and suggest that a theta-dominated microstate in the ERP may reflect a basic processing stage of stimulus evaluation, during which interfering activations from other frequency networks are minimized."

These alterations may be critically related to the biological substrate of MF transsexualism.
Are neuroprotective effects of hyperbaric oxygen treatment in experimental focal cerebral ischemia associated with reduced brain leukocyte myeloperoxidase activity?,These data confirm the neuroprotective effects of HBO in cerebral ischemia and suggest that the mechanism of this action may involve inhibition of PMN infiltration in the injured brain.
Do magnetic resonance imaging analysis of anterior and posterior eye segment displacement during ocular gaze shifts?,"Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the relationship between anterior and posterior eye segments was different during horizontal and vertical eye movements, indicating the presence of more than one center of rotation. Compared to the anterior eye segment, there was less displacement of the posterior eye segment during horizontal eye movements and more displacement during vertical eye movements."
Is the symmetry of initial divisions of human hematopoietic progenitors altered only by the cellular microenvironment?,"For the first time, we have demonstrated that asymmetric divisions can be altered upon exposure with a stem cell-supporting microenvironment. For the primitive subset of cells (ML-IC), this was predominantly due to recruitment into cell cycle and increased rounds of cycling without loss of function. Exposure to AFT024 cells also increased proliferation and asymmetric divisions of committed CFC. Hence direct communication between hematopoietic progenitors with stroma cells is required for maintaining self-renewal potential."
Does [ 8-Chloro-adenosine increase the activity of transcription factor CREB by modification of phosphorylation ]?,"The increase of transcriptional activity of CREB induced by 8-Cl-Ado depends on the increased level of phosphorylated CREB, but is not associated with the protein level and DNA binging level of CREB."
Do 14-3-3 dimers probe the assembly status of multimeric membrane proteins?,The COPI vesicle coat and proteins of the 14-3-3 family recognize arginine-based ER localization signals on multimeric membrane proteins. The equilibrium between these two competing reactions depends on the valency and spatial arrangement of the signal-containing tails. We propose a mechanism in which 14-3-3 bound to the correctly assembled multimer mediates release of the complex from the ER.
Do pTEN/MMAC1 mutations correlate inversely with an altered p53 tumor suppressor gene in gynecologic tumors?,"This study showed that in mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene correlated inversely with an altered p53 status. Similar findings were found in 2 tumor cell lines examined. As p53 changes are associated with late stage cancers, we favor the possibility that in certain tumor subtypes, PTEN/MMAC1 genes alteration may be useful clinically in the evaluation of the tumor."

Does amount of co-transplanted donor-derived leukocytes determine in-vivo microchimerism and mixed lymphocyte culture changes post-liver transplantation?,The results from these studies of microchimerism and lymphocyte reactivity after liver transplantation suggest that the co-transplantation of donor leukocytes plays an important and active role in the modulation of the host-immune system.
Does adjuvant immunization of HLA-A2-positive melanoma patients with a modified gp100 peptide induce peptide-specific CD8+ T-cell responses?,"Flow cytometric analysis of HLA/peptide-tetramer binding cells was a reliable means of quantifying the CD8+ T-cell response to peptide immunization. This assay may be suitable for use in future trials to optimize different vaccination strategies. Concurrent interferon treatment did not inhibit the development of a peptide-specific immune response and vaccination every 2 weeks, and every 3 weeks produced similar results."
Does type 2 diabetes mellitus affect eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori?,Type 2 diabetic patients showed a significantly lower eradication rate than controls which may be due to changes in microvasculature of the stomach and to frequent antibiotic usage because of recurrent bacterial infections with the development of resistant strains.
Does a needs-based study and examination skills course improve students ' performance?,"Learning activities that are directly based on student needs, that focus on study and examination techniques, and that are largely student-driven, result in effective and valuable outcomes."
Do endogenous estradiol metabolites stimulate the in vitro proliferation of human osteoblastic cells?,"The present results suggest that endogenous estradiol metabolites are capable of stimulating the proliferation of human female osteoblastic cells. None of the estradiol metabolites examined inhibited cell proliferation. Thus, estradiol metabolism may play a decisive role in development and maintenance of bone mass."
Is low educational performance associated with drunk driving : a 31-year follow-up of the northern Finland 1966 birth cohort?,"These results are unlikely to be directly causal; however, educational failures seem to be part of the complex causal pathway to drunk driving and even to alcohol-related disorders."

Does asian-Pacific Islander race independently predict poor outcome in patients with endometrial cancer?,"African-Americans and Asian-Pacific Islanders had worse survivals than Caucasians. After controlling for imbalances in clinicopathologic factors, Asian-Pacific Islander race was found to be a newly identified poor prognostic factor."
Is selection for medical school : just pick the right students and the rest easy?,"Critical appraisal of custom and practice and the development of new strategies, criteria and selection instruments go only part way to informing best practice. As with other UK medical schools grappling with these issues, the test of these selection processes lies in their product."
Are oral contraceptive pills associated with artifacts in ThinPrep Pap smears that mimic low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions?,"The ThinPrep induces changes that mimic LGSIL in young women on OCP. These artifacts may reflect pressure-induced alteration of glycogen. PAS analysis and, more directly, HPV testing by in situ hybridization can help differentiate this mimicking from actual LGSILs."
Does darbepoetin alfa have a longer circulating half-life and greater in vivo potency than recombinant human erythropoietin?,Increasing the sialic acid-containing carbohydrate content beyond the maximum found in EPO leads to a molecule with a longer circulating half-life and thereby an increased in vivo potency that can be administered less frequently.
Is presence of magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis a significant determinant of the first 3 years growth response to human growth hormone treatment in prepubertal children with nonacquired growth hormone deficiency?,"The detection of congenital abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary area on MRI is more important than the level of maximum stimulated GH to predict the growth response to hGH treatment in prepubertal nonacquired GH-deficient children. Although the persistence of GH deficiency remains to be confirmed during follow-up by reassessment of GH secretion in isolated GH-deficient patients with normal MRI findings, further studies are needed to evaluate whether an increased hGH dose in these patients could improve long-term growth response."
Do developmental binge exposure to ethanol and artificial rearing affect the social transfer of diet preference?,"Intact performance on the ethologically meaningful diet-preference test supports specificity in the cognitive/behavioral effects of developmental exposure to ethanol. Interestingly, early isolation, as experienced in the artificial-rearing procedure, also did not impair performance on this social task."

Does mindfulness-based stress reduction lower psychological distress in medical students?,MBSR may be an effective stress management intervention for medical students.
Does growth hormone treatment improve body composition in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome?,"This study shows beneficial effects of GH treatment on body composition in adult PWS patients without significant side-effects. Consequently, further studies are encouraged."
Is termination of breastfeeding after 12 months of age due to a new pregnancy and other causes associated with increased mortality in Guinea-Bissau?,"Popular rationalizations of abstinence during breastfeeding emphasizes, as we observed, that weaning due to new pregnancy of the mother is associated with higher mortality. This was not due to a shorter breastfeeding period of the child weaned due to a new pregnancy. Generally children weaned for other reasons than 'being healthy' had higher mortality. The mother's reason for weaning could potentially be used as screening criteria in child monitoring programmes in areas with high mortality."
Do optokinetic drum tilt hastens the onset of vection-induced motion sickness?,"In a tilted drum, the vestibular system correctly indicates that the participant is stationary while the visual system indicates a complex type of self-rotation. This type of sensory conflict is more severe than what takes place under typical optokinetic drum conditions (no tilt). Results suggest that as visual/vestibular sensory conflict increases, so does the speed at which motion sickness symptoms occur."
Does subcutaneously administered efalizumab ( anti-CD11a ) improve signs and symptoms of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis?,"The SC administration of eight weekly doses of efalizumab improves signs and symptoms of psoriasis. The treatment was safe and very well tolerated. In comparison to previously published results with IV efalizumab, SC administration of efalizumab improves overall safety and tolerability, with the additional advantage of greater convenience."
Do optimizing the number of electrodes with high-rate stimulation of the clarion CII cochlear implant?,"We conclude that speech perception (especially in noise) can improve significantly with ""high-rate"" speech processing strategies, provided that the optimum number of electrodes is determined for each patient individually."
Do patients over 45 years with iron deficiency require investigation?,"The study shows that the yield of investigation of iron deficiency is high and, hence, it should be investigated in all patients over the age of 45 years. Despite guidelines published by the BSG, IDA is investigated sub-optimally and measures other than the issuing of guidelines are needed to change practice."
Does glycomacropeptide and alpha-lactalbumin supplementation of infant formula affect growth and nutritional status in infant rhesus monkeys?,"Glycomacropeptide- or alpha-lactalbumin-supplemented formula has no adverse effects on nutritional status in infant monkeys. Glycomacropeptide supplementation increases zinc absorption, which may permit the reduction of formula zinc concentrations, and alpha-lactalbumin supplementation promotes a plasma amino acid pattern similar to that of breastfed infant monkeys."
Does split-liver transplantation eliminate the need for living-donor liver transplantation in children with end-stage cholestatic liver disease?,"SLT can provide liver grafts for children with ESCLD with an outcome similar to the one reported following LDLT, eliminating mortality while they are on a transplantation wait list. The need for pediatric LDLT should be reevaluated and programs of SLT strongly encouraged and supported at a national and international level."
Do energy-dense meals improve energy intake in elderly residents in a nursing home?,"Addition of natural energy-dense ingredients to regular meals is an inexpensive way to improve voluntary energy intake in elderly nursing home residents, a treatment that was accompanied by maintained ADL function."
Does use of aspirin in conjunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors worsen long-term survival in heart failure?,"In patients with a principal discharge diagnosis of heart failure, the use of aspirin, in combination with ACE-I, does not worsen long-term survival compared to the use of ACE-I without aspirin."

Are inherited thrombophilias increased in `` idiopathic '' small-for-gestational-age pregnancies?,The rates of these inherited thrombophilias are not increased in normotensive women with small-for-gestational-age pregnancies. Further studies are required to determine whether thrombophilias are increased in small-for-gestational-age babies with abnormal umbilical Doppler study results.
Does early neutrophil engraftment following autologous BMT provide a functional predictor of long-term hematopoietic reconstitution?,TNE is an in vivo functional measure of LHR and is a more sensitive predictor of LHR at 1 year after BMT than either CD34+ cell dose or CFU-GM infused.
Do antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against aspartyl ( asparaginyl ) beta-hydroxylase suppress migration of cholangiocarcinoma cells?,AAH over-expression may contribute to the infiltrative growth pattern of cholangiocarcinoma cells by promoting motility.
Is delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) effective in the treatment of tics in Tourette syndrome : a 6-week randomized trial?,"Our results provide more evidence that THC is effective and safe in the treatment of tics. It, therefore, can be hypothesized that the central cannabinoid receptor system might play a role in TS pathology."
Is coefficient D ( av ) more sensitive than fractional anisotropy in monitoring progression of irreversible tissue damage in focal nonactive multiple sclerosis lesions?,"Coefficient D(av) is more sensitive than FA to variations in the degree of T1 hypointensity and, thus, in the amount of the permanent brain tissue damage in patients with MS."

Are flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus associated with daily psychological stress?,These results suggest that psychological stress is associated with flares in SLE. Particularly daily stress with social relationships and social duties may be factors to be related to the course of disease activity in SLE.
Do cD103 mRNA levels in urinary cells predict acute rejection of renal allografts?,"CD103 mRNA levels in urinary cells are diagnostic of acute rejection of renal allografts. Because CD103 is a cell surface marker of intratubular CD8 CTLs, a noninvasive assessment of cellular traffic into the allograft may be feasible by the measurement of CD103 mRNA levels in urinary cells."
Does serum ferritin level predict advanced hepatic fibrosis among U.S. patients with phenotypic hemochromatosis?,"Patients with hemochromatosis and serum ferritin levels less than 1000 microg/L are unlikely to have cirrhosis. Liver biopsy to screen for cirrhosis may be unnecessary in such patients, regardless of age or serum liver enzyme levels."
Is carbohydrate metabolism impaired after 3 years of growth hormone therapy in children with Prader-Willi syndrome?,"Children with PWS are characterized by an intact insulin sensitivity with a decrease and a delay of insulin secretion, regardless of moderate obesity or GH treatment. In the present setting, the carbohydrate metabolism is not impaired by GH therapy, but by the excessively increased fat mass."
Is cognitive impairment related to cerebral lactate in patients with carotid artery occlusion and ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks?,This exploratory study in patients with CAO and ipsilateral TIA showed that 1H-MR spectroscopy-detected lactate in noninfarcted regions is a better indicator of cognitive impairment than MRI-detected lesions. Cognitive impairment did not correlate with CO2 reactivity.
Do detection of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma with dynamic magnetic resonance imaging with simultaneously obtained in-phase and opposed-phase echo images?,Dynamic MR imaging with double-phase images was recommended for the detection of hypervascular HCC.
Do [ Sleepy drivers have a high frequency of traffic accidents related to respiratory effort-related arousals ]?,The high risk of traffic accidents among sleepy drivers is mainly determined by the presence of RERA rather than the presence of apneas and hypopneas. These findings verify the importance of identifying RERA in routine sleep laboratory studies.
Do manic symptoms in young males with ADHD predict functioning but not diagnosis after 6 years?,"Although a pilot study in scope, the findings cast doubt on a link between mania symptoms associated with ADHD in childhood and later bipolar disorder."
Is human recombinant anti-transglutaminase antibody testing useful in the diagnosis of silent coeliac disease in a selected group of at-risk patients?,"Both CHT and functional dyspepsia may represent a true oligosymptomatic form of coeliac disease. In such conditions, the detection of anti-tTG antibodies is useful as a screening method. Coeliac disease is not an autoimmune manifestation of HCV, so screening for coeliac disease in HCV patients cannot be recommended."
Is eMAP-II expression associated with macrophage accumulation in primary uveal melanoma?,"In uveal melanoma, macrophages accumulate at sites of EMAP-II expression. Based on the results, it may be hypothesized that this process of chemotaxis is facilitated by EMAP-II-dependent expression of ICAM-1 on vascular endothelial cells and concomitantly leads to localized vascular damage, as indicated by release of von Willebrand factor."
Is diastolic response during dobutamine stress echocardiography evaluated by a tissue velocity imaging technique a sensitive indicator for diagnosing coronary artery disease?,The analysis of regional left ventricular diastolic responses to dobutamine stress using TVI was useful for the objective diagnosis of CAD.
Does igG in brain correlate with clinicopathological damage in HTLV-1 associated neurologic disease?,Patients with HAM/TSP develop antibodies specific for neurons and axons that are preferentially damaged in the CNS.
Is intractable temporal lobe epilepsy with rare spikes less severe than with frequent spikes?,"This study identified a subgroup of patients with nonlesional intractable TLE with no or few IEA. Oligospikers have a later age at seizure onset, less frequent and less severe seizures, besides a lower incidence of HA. The similarity of etiologic factors compared with patients with frequent IEA suggests that the rarity of spikes could reflect a disease not really distinct but less severe, even though still intractable and incapacitating enough to consider surgery. In spite of the absence or paucity of IEA, oligospikers have excellent surgical outcome."
Is survivin expression in human osteosarcoma a marker for survival?,The results of this study indicates that the evaluation of survivin expression might be a useful prognostic marker in osteosarcoma. Patients with osteosarcoma exhibiting nuclear survivin expression could potentially benefit from stratification of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Does comparison of facial nerve function result after translabyrinthine and retrosigmoid approach in medium-sized tumors?,"Although the translabyrinthine approach may offer better long-term facial function compared with the retrosigmoid approach in patients with medium-sized tumors, the difference between these 2 groups was not significant enough to favor one approach over the other."

Do citation indexes reflect methodological quality in lung cancer randomised trials?,"Journals with higher citation factors do not appear to publish clinical trials with higher levels of methodological quality, at least for trials in the field of lung cancer research."
Does prior short-term consumption of resistant starch enhance postprandial insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects?,Prior acute consumption of a high-dose of resistant starch enhanced carbohydrate handling in the postprandial period the following day potentially due to the increased rate of colonic fermentation.
Does hTERT mRNA expression correlate with telomerase activity in human breast cancer?,hTERT mRNA expression significantly correlates with telomerase activity in human breast cancer. This is consistent with the hypothesis that hTERT is the catalytic and rate-limiting determinant subunit of the enzyme.
Does tranexamic acid decrease external blood loss but not hidden blood loss in total knee replacement?,"Tranexamic acid decreased total blood loss by nearly 30%, drainage volume by approximately 50% and drastically reduced transfusion. However, concealed loss was only marginally influenced by tranexamic acid and was at least as large as the drainage volume."
Does insulin gene transfer enhance the function of human islet grafts?,Our results suggest a simple and effective approach that could enhance the efficiency of islet transplantation for treatment of diabetes in humans.
Do ethiopian-born and native Israeli school children have different growth patterns?,"The Azezo study confirmed that malnutrition-induced developmental impairment in preschool children is a major problem in Ethiopia. It is a manifestation of a rural economic and educational poverty and cannot be eradicated by palliative short-term nutritional programs. Although ethnicity and prenatal and postnatal malnutrition may have contributed, an insufficiency or imbalance of vital nutrients appeared to be the determinant factor for the lower relative growth of the Ethiopian-born children. The children from Ethiopia may have a propensity to avoid certain foods because of digestive intolerance or early childhood dietary habituation. Parental financial constraint may have been a factor in the younger group. These findings have implications for nutrition and welfare policies for children emigrating from developing countries."
Does gapCoder automate the use of indel characters in phylogenetic analysis?,"Manual implementation of the simple indel coding method can be very time-consuming, especially in data sets where indels are numerous and/or overlapping. GapCoder automates this method and is therefore particularly useful during procedures where phylogenetic analyses need to be repeated many times, such as when different alignments are being explored or when various taxon or character sets are being explored. GapCoder is currently available for Windows from http://www.home.duq.edu/~youngnd/GapCoder."
Are the alpha2 and alpha3 integrins required for morphologic differentiation of an intestinal epithelial cell line?,We demonstrated that signaling through both constitutively expressed alpha2 integrin and Matrigel-induced alpha3 integrin expression is required to acquire a differentiated phenotype in Caco-2 cells.
Does prophylactic clip application decrease delayed bleeding after colonoscopic polypectomy?,Prophylactic clip placement did not decrease the occurrence of delayed bleeding after colonoscopic polypectomy.
Are cranial MRI scans indicated in all girls with central precocious puberty?,"Girls with CPP should have a cranial MRI scan as part of their assessment since clinical features, including age, are not helpful in predicting those with underlying pathology. Implementation of such an approach may have a substantial effect on clinical practice and healthcare cost."
Is immunophenotyping an independent factor for risk stratification in AML?,"Immunophenotyping is not only helpful for diagnosis but is of independent significance for prognosis, and may be useful for risk stratification in AML patients."

Does farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 prevent autocrine growth stimulation of neuroblastoma by BDNF?,Farnesyltransferase inhibitors are active against neuroblastoma cells but the mechanism of action is not limited to inactivation of Ras. Further investigations on the targets of FTI-277 are recommended.
Does gene expression profiling reveal distinct features of various porcine adipose tissues?,"The present study provided the evidence of gene expression profiling that the subcutaneous adipose tissues are mainly affected the metabolism process, whereas the visceral and intermuscular adipose tissues should been term as the metabolic risk factors of obesity."
Is low cerebral blood flow associated with lower memory function in metabolic syndrome?,The results underscore the importance of reducing the number of cardiovascular risk factors for maintaining CBF and cognition in an aging population.
Does assessment of ventricular repolarization variability with the DeltaT50 method improve identification of patients with congenital long QT syndromes?,DeltaT50 more accurately distinguished between LQTS patients and HV than QTcF and was higher in LQTS patients with a higher risk of cardiac events. DeltaT50 can be used together with QTcF to improve the diagnosis in patients with the LQTS phenotype and tentatively also be of value for risk assessment in such patients.
Do poststroke outcomes vary by pathogenic stroke subtype in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study?,"Although the highest mortality was observed for intracerebral hemorrhage, there was significant burden of recurrent stroke and hospital readmissions for lacunar and cardioembolic strokes, respectively. There may be opportunities to reduce the relatively high rate of poststroke readmissions."
"Is aPACHE II score superior to SOFA , CTP and MELD in predicting the short-term mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure ( ACLF )?",Short-term mortality is high in patients with ACLF. APACHE II scoring system is superior to other prognostic scores in predicting its short-term mortality.
Is predominant mucosal IL-8 mRNA expression in non-cagA Thais risk for gastric cancer?,"Predominant gastric mucosal IL-8 mRNA expression level, H. pylori infection, and low PG I/II ratio are relative risks for Thai gastric cancer without correlation with cagA mutation."
Do brief episodes of silent atrial fibrillation predict clinical vascular brain disease in type 2 diabetic patients?,Subclinical episodes of AF occurred frequently in type 2 diabetic patients and were associated with a significantly increased risk of SCI and stroke.
Is advanced adenoma detection rate independent of nonadvanced adenoma detection rate?,Advanced ADR is variable among colonoscopists with acceptable ADRs. Colonoscopists' advanced ADRs are independent of their nonadvanced ADRs.
Are aging phenotypes in cultured normal human mammary epithelial cells correlated with decreased telomerase activity independent of telomere length?,"Telomere shortening did not correlate with the chronological ages of HMEC strains, whereas decreased telomerase activity correlated with age and with lineage distribution phenotypes characteristic of aging."
Do positive academic emotions moderate the relationship between self-regulation and academic achievement?,"Enjoyment and pride were both positive predictors of grades; more importantly, both moderated the relationship between self-regulation and grades. For students who report higher levels of both positive emotions, self-regulation was positively associated with grades. However, for those who report lower levels of pride, self-regulation was not related to grades; and, for those who reported lower levels of enjoyment, self-regulation was negatively related to grades.

Does vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) exacerbate endotoxin-induced uveitis ( EIU ) in mice?,"This study further established the paradoxical observation that EIU is exacerbated by lowering the levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular TNF-alpha."
Is [ The enjoyment of red wine influenced by the shape of the wine glass ]?,"The present data indicate that egg-shaped glasses, compared to ""tulip"" or ""beaker"" glasses, appear to produce higher intensity and higher complexity of wine odors. This may relate to the trapping of odors in egg-shaped glasses."
Does influence of bone densitometry result on the treatment of osteoporosis?,"The proportion of women with osteoporosis receiving hormone replacement therapy or bisphosphonate therapy increases after diagnosis with densitometry. However, communication by physicians so that patients understand their test results is a critical component in the initiation of therapy after bone densitometry."
Does bDNF enhance retinal ganglion cell survival in cats with optic nerve damage?,"The data show that BDNF is an effective neuroprotectant in primate-sized eyes after optic nerve injury. Although the amount required to achieve neuroprotection is much greater than that needed for the small rat eye (30 microg versus 0.5 microg), when differences in vitreal volume are considered, the effective dose is similar (0.01 microg BDNF/microl vitreal volume). High doses of BDNF induce inflammation and result in a decrease in total ganglion cell survival but appear necessary to save medium-sized neurons, which are affected most severely by nerve injury."
"Are infant plasma trans , n-6 , and n-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids related to maternal plasma fatty acids , length of gestation , and birth weight and length?",The results suggest possible important effects of TFAs and of AA on fetal growth and length of gestation.
Does low-dose vitamin B-6 effectively lower fasting plasma homocysteine in healthy elderly persons who are folate and riboflavin replete?,Low-dose vitamin B-6 effectively lowers fasting plasma tHcy in healthy subjects who are both folate and riboflavin replete. This suggests that any program aimed at the treatment or prevention of hyperhomocysteinemia should include vitamin B-6 supplementation.
Does daily coping practice predict treatment effects in children with sickle cell disease?,Brief training in coping skills followed by minimal therapist contact may lead to a range of benefits when children practice with their skills on a consistent basis.
Does lymphovascular invasion enhance the prediction of non-sentinel node metastases in breast cancer patients with positive sentinel nodes?,"Patients with small breast cancers, no LVI, and SLN micrometastases have a low risk of non-SLN metastases, and may not require completion ALND."
Is the occipital cortex hyperexcitable in migraine : experimental evidence?,There is a difference in threshold for excitability of occipital cortex in migraineurs and controls. The hyperexcitable visual cortex in migraine is predisposed to visually triggered headache.
Do markers of renal tubular dysfunction measured annually predict risk of microalbuminuria in the first few years after diagnosis of Type I diabetes?,Raised amounts of urine retinol binding protein and N-acetyl-glycosaminidase are related to HbA1c and the duration of diabetes. They occur in the majority of subjects and are not early markers for the risk of microalbuminuria.
Is a novel CD44 v3 isoform involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression?,HNSCC tissue and FaDu appear to express CD44v3 isoforms. These isoforms may promote tumorigenesis.
Does application of HIV-1 genotypic-resistance testing prevent the evolution of further resistance mutations in heavily pretreated patients?,"GRT is predictive of the efficacy of a therapeutic regimen, in particular regarding evolution of further resistance mutations."
Does aggressive management lead to improved survival in patients with small cell lung carcinoma?,The presented data suggest that appropriate aggressive management of patients with SCLC leads to a significant increase in median survival. This survival benefit is most apparent in patients with limited disease.
Do entry criteria and baseline characteristics predict outcome in acute stroke trials?,"-Acute stroke studies vary widely in entry criteria and outcome measures. Across multiple studies, differences in entry criteria, and the baseline clinical characteristics they predict, influence patient outcomes along a continuum. In some studies, enrolling a specific subset of patients may have improved the chances of identifying a treatment-related effect, while in others, such chances may have been reduced. These findings may be useful in the design of future stroke therapeutic trials."
Does huperzine A ameliorate the impaired memory of aged rat in the Morris water maze performance?,Huperzine A ameliorates the impaired memory naturally occurring or induced by scopolamine in aged rats.
Do high and low neuroticism predict different cortisol responses to the combined dexamethasone -- CRH test?,The mechanism of this effect remains to be elucidated. High-neuroticism subjects may have a downregulated hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal axis to prevent harmful overactivation. This is the first demonstration of a difference in hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal axis regulation associated with neuroticism.
Is preoperative thrombocytosis an independent prognostic factor in stage III and IV endometrial cancer?,Thrombocytosis is an independent prognostic factor in stage III and IV endometrial cancer.
Does fluorescence endoscopy with 5-aminolevulinic acid reduce early recurrence rate in superficial bladder cancer?,ALA fluorescence endoscopy is an innocuous and inexpensive diagnostic procedure that significantly improves bladder tumor detection rates compared to standard white light endoscopy. In our controlled study ALA fluorescence endoscopy reduced the residual tumor detection rate at second look transurethral resection by 59%.
Does the impact of maternal ketonuria on fetal test result in the setting of postterm pregnancy?,"Maternal ketonuria among patients with postterm pregnancy was associated with a >2-fold increase in the occurrence of oligohydramnios, a 3-fold increase in nonreactive nonstress tests, and a significant increase in fetal heart rate decelerations. Further studies are required to evaluate the potential benefits of treating ketonuria before fetal testing."
Is upregulation of gap junctional intercellular communication and connexin 43 expression by cyclic-AMP and all-trans-retinoic acid associated with glutathione depletion and chemosensitivity in neuroblastoma cells?,"This study suggests that GJIC plays a role in cellular drug resistance, and highlights the potential use of GJIC modulators in combination with chemotherapy. Also, this is the first study exploring the ability of both db-cAMP and tRA to enhance cell chemosensitivity."
Is patients receiving immunotherapy report it effective as assessed by the rhinitis outcomes questionnaire ( ROQ ) in a private practice setting?,This study demonstrates that the user-friendly ROQ can be effectively and inexpensively used in a private practice setting and that immunotherapy is effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.
Is nuclear beta catenin expression related to unfavourable outcome in oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma?,Reduced expression of gamma catenin is associated with dedifferentiation in primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and hypopharynx. The fact that nuclear beta catenin expression independently predicts short overall survival suggests that it might be a valuable prognostic marker in pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
Does frontal lobe hypometabolism predict cognitive decline in patients with lacunar infarcts?,Cognitive decline in patients with lacunes may result in part from progressive vascular compromise in subcortical frontal circuits.
Does hepatocyte growth factor suppress interstitial fibrosis in a mouse model of obstructive nephropathy?,"Endogenous as well as exogenous HGF attenuated the progression of the fibrosis caused by obstructive nephropathy in these mice. Thus, local reduction in HGF levels may account for TIF in chronic renal diseases."
Does selective blockade of vasopressin V2 receptors reveal significant V2-mediated water reabsorption in Brattleboro rats with diabetes insipidus?,"(i) SR is a potent orally active aquaretic and induces stable effects during 1 week in rats with or without endogenous AVP secretion. (ii) Significant V2 receptor-mediated water reabsorption occurs in collecting ducts of Brattleboro DI rats because their usual urine osmolality is about twofold higher than the minimum observed during SR-induced maximum diuresis. (iii) This V2 agonism could be mediated in part by OT binding to V2 receptors. Small amounts of endogenous AVP, known to be produced by adrenal and testis in DI rats, could also contribute to this V2 agonism, as well as a possible constitutive activation of the V2 receptors. (iv) In normal rats, AVP probably reduces water losses through extrarenal sites, probably the lungs."
Do garlic shows promise for improving some cardiovascular risk factors?,"Trials suggest possible small short-term benefits of garlic on some lipid and antiplatelet factors, insignificant effects on blood pressure, and no effect on glucose levels. Conclusions regarding clinical significance are limited by the marginal quality and short duration of many trials and by the unpredictable release and inadequate definition of active constituents in study preparations."
Do mild cognitive impairments predict dementia in nondemented elderly patients with memory loss?,"Among nondemented elderly patients, memory loss alone rarely progresses to dementia in the subsequent 2 years. However, the risk of dementia is significantly increased among patients with clear cognitive impairments beyond memory loss. Further study is needed to determine whether patients with impairments limited to memory loss have a distinctive clinical course or pathophysiology."
Is response of patients with Alzheimer disease to rivastigmine treatment predicted by the rate of disease progression?,Rate of disease progression for patients with mild to moderate AD seems to predict response to rivastigmine treatment. Patients with more rapidly progressive disease might be particularly likely to benefit from rivastigmine therapy.
Is pentagon copying more impaired in dementia with Lewy bodies than in Alzheimer 's disease?,"For patients with MMSE scores > or = 13, an inability to accurately copy the pentagons suggests that the diagnosis is more likely DLB than AD. The results confirm the work of others on visuospatial/constructional impairment in DLB and indicate that this feature may be helpful in its diagnosis."
Does incidental parathyroidectomy during thyroid surgery cause transient symptomatic hypocalcemia?,"Unintended parathyroidectomy, although not uncommon, is not associated with symptomatic postoperative hypocalcemia. Modified radical neck dissection may increase the risk of incidental parathyroidectomy. Most of the glands removed were intrathyroidal, so changes in surgical technique are unlikely to markedly reduce this risk."
Does intraneuronal abeta-amyloid precede development of amyloid plaques in Down syndrome?,"We propose the following sequence of events in the development of neuropathologic changes of Alzheimer disease in Down syndrome: (1) intracellular accumulation of Abeta in neurons and astrocytes, (2) deposition of extracellular Abeta and formation of diffuse plaques, and (3) development of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles with activation of microglial cells."
Does aTP-binding cassette transporter A1 ( ABCA1 ) affect total body sterol metabolism?,The metabolism of cholesterol and cholesterol precursors is markedly affected by a lack of ABCA1 function.
Is traditional couching an effective alternative procedure for cataract surgery in Mali?,"In Mali, two types of providers offer two different interventions to treat cataract-blind persons. This study suggests that the couching method used by traditional healers is relatively expensive and ineffective. It is also potentially dangerous although this study did not address this question specifically. It is important that health policy makers and medical authorities do what they can to prevent traditional healers from performing the couching procedure, as well as informing the population about the existence of a more-effective and safer alternative. However, while more effective and safer, the results obtained by ICCE are not excellent either. Further, it is important to improve the quality of ophthalmic services in order to provide cataract patients with the best, most accessible and least expensive services possible."
Does timing of excessive ultraviolet radiation and melanoma : epidemiology support the existence of a critical period of high susceptibility to solar ultraviolet radiation- induced melanoma?,Our data do not provide supporting evidence for the existence of a 'critical period'. The hazardous impact of sunburns seems to persist lifelong and thus activities concerned with melanoma prevention should be directed to the entire population rather than being focused only on younger age groups.
Does the rate of tumour growth distinguish between malignant and benign thyroid nodules?,The rate of growth of thyroid nodules as documented by ultrasound did not prove to be useful in distinguishing between malignancy and benign disease of small thyroid nodules (<20 mm).
Does [ Contrast agent improve diagnostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography ]?,Contrast agent improves the diagnostic accuracy of dobutamine stress echocardiography in the left circumflex artery territory.
Is urine necessary to provoke bladder inflammation in protamine sulfate induced urothelial injury?,"Bladder inflammation in this experimental model of urothelial injury was not due to protamine sulfate alone. The association of protamine sulfate and urine was necessary to trigger the inflammatory cascade. Thus, urine indeed has an important role in the development of bladder inflammation in an environment of higher urothelial permeability."
Does the transcriptional cofactor MIER1-beta negatively regulate histone acetyltransferase activity of the CREB-binding protein?,Our data indicate that an additional mechanism by which MIER1 could repress transcription involves the inhibition of histone acetyltransferase activity.
Is the use of more than one inotrope in acute heart failure associated with increased mortality : a multi-centre observational study?,"Inotrope administration is a marker of increased mortality in patients with acute heart failure. Still, the use of a single inotrope during hospital stay seems rather safe."
Are effects of acute insulin-induced hypoglycaemia on psychomotor function : people with type 1 diabetes less affected than non-diabetic adults?,"Although acute hypoglycaemia caused significant impairment of several psychomotor functions in non-diabetic adults, a lower magnitude of impairment was observed in those with type 1 diabetes. The mechanism underlying this discrepant effect of hypoglycaemia on psychomotor function remains unknown, but may be related to the difference in sympathoadrenal activation observed between the groups. People with type 1 diabetes may also have had a behavioural advantage of over non-diabetic participants derived from their previous exposure to hypoglycaemia or potentially the disparate results arose from hypoglycaemia-induced cerebral adaptation."
Is high level of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 expression associated with cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma?,"High MKP-1 expression is associated with decreased sensitivity or increased resistance to cisplatin-induced cell death in OS cell lines, and MKP-1 could potentially be used as a marker of cisplatin resistance and a therapeutic target for molecular therapies."
Are motor and somatosensory evoked potentials well maintained in patients given dexmedetomidine during spine surgery?,Use of dexmedetomidine as an anesthetic adjunct at target plasma concentrations up to 0.6 ng/ml does not change somatosensory or motor evoked potential responses during complex spine surgery by any clinically significant amount.
Are low total plasma carotenoids independent predictors of mortality among older persons : the InCHIANTI study?,Low plasma carotenoids are an independent risk factor for mortality among older adults living in the community.
Does intermittent torsion of the spermatic cord portend an increased risk of acute testicular infarction?,"When diagnosed accurately, intermittent spermatic cord torsion can be treated with elective testicular fixation with an excellent outcome. Misdiagnosis may create a cohort of boys with intermittent spermatic cord torsion who are at risk for acute unresolved torsion and potential testicular loss. Urologists should be proactive in recommending elective scrotal exploration when intermittent spermatic cord torsion is a likely diagnosis."
Do persistent motor deficits predict long-term bladder dysfunction in children following acute transverse myelitis?,Motor and bladder recovery were related in our patients with transverse myelitis. Children with no motor recovery did not experience bladder recovery. No significant bladder recovery was seen beyond 4 months in our patients.
Is extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in children : equivalent clearance rates to adults achieved with fewer and lower energy shock waves?,ESWL is as safe and effective in children as in adults for solitary renal and upper ureteric stones that are <2 cm. Children required significantly fewer and lower energy SWs to achieve equivalent results.
Are human neuroblastoma cells transfected with two Chinese presenilin 1 mutations sensitized to trophic factor withdrawal and protected by insulin-like growth factor-1?,"Enhanced sensitivity to trophic withdrawal in the cells transfected with the two Chinese PS1 mutations may contribute to the neuron apoptosis. IGF-1 provided a protective effect to cells, possibly through an enhanced glucose transport and mitochondrial activities."
Does nephrectomy improve the survival of patients with locally advanced renal cell carcinoma?,"Relative to non-surgical treatment, nephrectomy improves the cancer-specific survival of patients with locally advanced RCC; our findings await prospective confirmation."
Is loss of enterocyte mass accompanied by diminished turnover of enterocytes after myeloablative therapy in haematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients?,"Simultaneous reduction and subsequent increase of citrulline and I-FABP and I-BABP levels following cytotoxic treatment show that enterocyte mass corresponds to lower rate of dying enterocytes, indicating reduced turnover of enterocytes. Assessment of enterocyte turnover and mass offers opportunities for evaluation of new MBI therapies."
Is association of narcolepsy-cataplexy with HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 in Mexican patients : a relationship between HLA and gender suggested?,This knowledge may contribute to a better understanding of the disease pathogenesis in different populations. The evaluation of the risk to develop narcolepsy-cataplexy in carriers of the described alleles/genotypes may also be possible. A larger sample should be analysed in Mexican and in other Hispanic patients to confirm these results.
Does vascular function assessed with cardiovascular magnetic resonance predict survival in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease?,Deranged vascular function measured with CMR correlates with cardiovascular risk factors and predicts outcome. CMR measures of vascular function are potential targets for interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk.
Does maternal depression predict maternal use of corporal punishment in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder?,Maternal depression contributes to the use of corporal punishment with children with ADHD. Assessment and management of the maternal depression should be an important focus of evaluation of children with ADHD.
Is epicardial adipose tissue thickness by echocardiography a marker for the presence and severity of coronary artery disease?,"EAT thickness, which is easily and non-invasively evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography, can be an adjunctive marker to classical risk factors for the prediction of CAD."
Does factors associated with fall in patients with cancer hospitalized for palliative care?,Characteristics of falls in palliative care appear different from those evidenced in geriatric wards. To prevent delirium while prescribing neuroleptic drugs with the greatest caution should help decrease the number of falls in this highly vulnerable group of patients.
Does [ Correlation of MRI feature to histopathologic grade of soft tissue sarcoma ]?,"The peripheral tumor growth pattern is related with histological grade, and may reflect the biological behaviors of soft tissue sarcoma."
Does combining early markers strongly predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer 's disease?,"The five-predictor combination strongly predicted conversion to AD and was markedly superior to combining age and MMSE. Combining the clinically administered measures also led to strong predictive accuracy. If independently replicated, the findings have potential utility for early detection of AD."
Does prognostic breast cancer signature identified from 3D culture model accurately predict clinical outcome across independent datasets?,The 3D-signature accurately predicts breast cancer outcome across multiple datasets and holds prognostic value for both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer. The signature was selected using a novel biological approach and hence holds promise to represent the key biological processes of breast cancer.
Does wuweizisu C from Schisandra chinensis decrease membrane potential in C6 glioma cells?,Our results suggest that the decrease in the membrane potential and the modulation of [Ca(2+)](i) concentration by wuweizisu C could be important action mechanisms of wuweizisu C.
Does myocardial regulation of p300 and p53 by doxorubicin involve ubiquitin pathways?,"Dox reciprocally regulates p300 and p53 through ubiquitin-dependent pathways and that p300, by its ubiquitin ligase activity, is partially involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 in cardiac myocytes."
Do mCP-1-deficient mice show reduced neuroinflammatory responses and increased peripheral inflammatory responses to peripheral endotoxin insult?,"MCP-1-/- mice have decreased brain inflammation after a peripheral LPS insult, despite an exaggerated peripheral response. These data demonstrate an important role for MCP-1 in regulation of brain inflammation after peripheral endotoxemia."
Does reduced oxygen due to high-altitude exposure relate to atrophy in motor-function brain areas?,These findings suggest that extremely high-altitude exposures may cause subtle white and grey matter changes that mainly affect brain regions involved in motor activity.
"Is cytokine IL-1 beta but not IL-1 alpha promoter polymorphism associated with Alzheimer disease in a population from the Canary Islands , Spain?","In our population, IL-1 beta promoter polymorphism (-511 C/T) is an independent risk factor for AD."
Is blood pressure associated with haematoma enlargement in acute intracerebral haemorrhage?,"In an exploratory analysis, we did not find an association between BP and HE within the first 24 h after an acute ICH."
Are histological features of human abdominal aortic aneurysm related to clinical characteristics?,We conclude that histologically AAA could not be classified in analogy to clinical characteristics. We suggest that progression of large AAA is mainly determined by parameters other than histological features of the diseased vessel wall.
Is the inhibition of insulin-stimulated proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells by rosiglitazone mediated by the Akt-mTOR-P70S6K pathway?,The inhibitory effect of rosiglitazone on RAoSMC proliferation in vitro and in vivo is mediated by the inhibition of the Akt-mTOR-P70S6K pathway.
Does ventricular function deteriorate with recurrent coarctation in hypoplastic left heart syndrome?,Recurrent aortic arch obstruction after stage I for HLHS is associated with worse RV systolic function at the time of stage II operation. Timely intervention on the re-CoA results in recovery of RV function.
Is the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele associated with cognitive dysfunction in cardiac surgery?,"Preexisting cognitive impairment and postoperative cognitive dysfunction are not associated with APOE epsilon4 genotype, suggesting that cognitive impairment both before and after CABG may not be associated with degenerative cognitive decline."
Does dual-frequency ultrasound technique minimize errors induced by soft tissue in ultrasound bone densitometry?,The DFUS technique may significantly enhance the accuracy of clinical ultrasound measurements of bone.
Is [ Combined use of pulmonary surfactants with continuous distending pressure useful in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in very low birth weight infants ]?,The combined use of PS with CDP can effectively improve pulmonary oxygenation and ventilation and shorten the duration of oxygen therapy and the length of hospital stay in VLBW infants with RDS.
Do simple counts of ADL dependencies adequately reflect older adults ' preferences toward states of functional impairment?,Our results suggest that the count of ADL dependencies does not adequately represent the utility for a health state. Cost-effectiveness analyses and other evaluations of programs that prevent or treat functional dependency should apply utility weights rather than relying on simple ADL counts.
Does murine cirrhosis induce hepatocyte epithelial mesenchymal transition and alterations in survival signaling pathways?,"CLDH have increased vimentin and type 1 collagen expression and morphologic features consistent with EMT. In addition, compared to NLDH, the cellular signaling phenotype of CLDH changes from a MAPK-independent pathway to a MAPK-dependent cell survival pathway. These findings may have clinical implications for chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma in the cirrhotic liver."
Does low-energy laser stimulate tooth movement velocity via expression of RANK and RANKL?,These findings suggest that low-energy laser irradiation stimulates the velocity of tooth movement via induction of RANK and RANKL.
Does neural progenitor cell-mediated delivery of interferon beta improve neuroblastoma response to cyclophosphamide?,"Targeted delivery of IFN-beta with NPCs produced low circulating levels of IFN-beta, yet the maturing effect on the tumor vasculature and the enhanced efficacy of adjuvant therapy was maintained. Thus, combination therapy of NPC-IFN-beta with CTX warrants further investigation for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma patients."
Is slow progression of chronic kidney disease and what it associated with?,"Timely recognition of risk factors for CKD progression and their treatment by correction of high blood pressure, reduction of proteinuria, correction of anaemia and dyslipidaemia (to lower cardiovascular risk) may retard progression of CKD to end-stage renal disease, thus delaying the need for renal replacement therapy."
Is wnt pathway involved in advanced gastric carcinoma?,"Wnt-1, beta-catenin and E-cadherin play an important role in the differentiation, progression, invasion and metastasis in gastric cancer; they are good indicators for evaluating the biological behaviors of gastric cancer. And also, they will be promising targets for developing anti-cancer drug in gastric cancer."
Does inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase produce PPAR-alpha-mediated analgesia in a rat model of inflammatory pain?,URB597 inhibited receptive field expansions but not mechanically evoked responses of spinal neurons in rats with hind paw inflammation. These effects were blocked by PPAR-alpha receptor antagonism. These data support the contention that URB597 exerts its antinociceptive effects by indirect inhibition of sensitization of neuronal responses at least partly through PPAR-alpha activation due to enhanced EC levels.
Do children with attention deficits concentrate better after walk in the park?,"Twenty minutes in a park setting was sufficient to elevate attention performance relative to the same amount of time in other settings. These findings indicate that environments can enhance attention not only in the general population but also in ADHD populations. ""Doses of nature"" might serve as a safe, inexpensive, widely accessible new tool in the tool kit for managing ADHD symptoms."
Do analysis of association of clinical aspects and vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism with dental implant loss?,"It was observed that clinical variables, but not the study polymorphism, were associated with dental implant loss."
Do histopathological characteristics of lymph node metastases predict cancer-specific survival in node-positive prostate cancer?,The histopathological characteristics of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer have predictive value for the clinical outcome. The nodal Gleason score and the diameter of the largest metastasis are independent predictors of survival.
Does pramlintide reduce the risks associated with glucose variability in type 1 diabetes?,"Risk analysis of the effect of pramlintide treatment demonstrated risk-reduction effects independent of changes in average glycemia, most notably reduced rate and magnitude of postprandial BG fluctuations. These effects were not accompanied by an increased risk of hypoglycemia."
Are children likely to suffer most from our fossil fuel addiction?,"Although much has been written separately about the toxicity of fossil fuel burning emissions and the effects of climate change on health, these two faces of the problem have not been viewed together with a focus on the developing fetus and child. Adolescence and old age are also periods of vulnerability, but the potential for both immediate and long-term adverse effects is greatest when exposure occurs prenatally or in the early years."
Are progesterone receptor gene polymorphisms associated with preterm birth in a Hispanic population?,The present study suggests that polymorphisms in the progesterone receptor gene are unlikely to be associated with an increased risk of preterm birth in a Hispanic population.
Is eGFR R497K polymorphism a favorable prognostic factor for advanced lung cancer?,"EGFR mutation status was not correlated with R497KEGFR genotype of lung cancers. In node-negative patients, R497KEGFR genotype was not correlated with disease outcome. In node-positive patients, however, R497K EGFR was significantly associated with better overall survival. This association was attributable to neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. In 46 total gefitinib treated NSCLC patients, the prognosis was not different between the EGFR wild type (GG) patients and AG+AA patients. R497KEGFR polymorphism might be associated with favorable prognosis of advanced lung cancers and correlated with chemosensitivity."
Is vincristine-induced neuropathy in the rat modified by drug-drug interactions with the P-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil?,Behavioral pain tests did not reveal an increase in vincristine neurotoxicity following combination treatment with verapamil and vincristine. This regimen only led to a slight increase in general toxicity.
Are differential expression of 12 histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) genes in astrocytomas and normal brain tissue : class II and IV hypoexpressed in glioblastomas?,Our study establishes a negative correlation between HDAC gene expression and the glioma grade suggesting that class II and IV HDACs might play an important role in glioma malignancy. Evaluation of histone acetylation levels showed that histone H3 is more acetylated in glioblastomas than normal brain tissue confirming the downregulation of HDAC mRNA in glioblastomas.
Is hypermethylation of E-cadherin an independent predictor of improved survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma?,"The current results suggested that hypermethylation of CDH1 occurs more commonly in patients with HNSCC who are low smokers, suggesting that an additional factor may be driving this epigenetic alteration. Clinically, CDH1 hypermethylation may hold powerful prognostic potential in addition to that observed with HPV serology, and the authors concluded that it should be pursued in additional studies."
Does oxcarbazepine treatment in male epilepsy patients improve pre-existing sexual dysfunction?,Oxcarbazepine was found to have beneficial effects on sexual dysfunction and to be effective and well tolerated in male patients with partial epilepsy.
Do the gingipains from Porphyromonas gingivalis directly induce osteoclast differentiation in primary mouse bone marrow cultures?,"The data presented here demonstrate that the gingipains do not induce osteoclast differentiation in this system, indicating that the bacterium uses other mechanisms to induce bone loss."
"Is degree of hyperinsulinemia , independent of androgen levels , an important determinant of the severity of hirsutism in PCOS?","Insulin appears to have a direct effect on the severity of hirsutism in PCOS and appears to have a synergistic interaction with TT. Notably, over 90% of the variation in the mFG score was not related to the factors studied and likely reflects intrinsic factors related to pilosebaceous unit function or sensitivity and to other factors not yet assessed."
Does the transcription factor gene FOXC1 exhibit a limited role in primary congenital glaucoma?,The present study indicates a limited role of FOXC1 in PCG pathogenesis.
Does risk-communication capability for public health emergencies vary by community diversity?,"The results of this study suggest the need to factor population diversity into risk communication plans and the need for improved state or regional risk-communication capabilities, especially for communities with limited local capacity."
Is leukocyte telomere length associated with cognitive performance in healthy women?,"Leukocyte telomere length correlates with a subset of measures of cognitive performance, suggesting that it might be a biomarker of cognitive aging in women before the onset of dementia."
Does genomic profiling reveal an alternate mechanism for hepatic tumor promotion by perfluorooctanoic acid in rainbow trout?,These data suggest that the tumor-promoting activities of PFOA in trout are due to novel mechanisms involving estrogenic signaling and are independent of peroxisome proliferation.
Do internet-based interventions have potential to affect short-term mediators and indicators of dietary behavior of young adults?,"The Internet is a favorable option for reaching young adults with nutrition messages. This study did not identify strong advantages of theory-based tailoring, especially for fruit consumption, which had weaker barriers than vegetable consumption among this target audience."
Do clinical features of mild cognitive impairment differ in the research and tertiary clinic settings?,The diagnosis of MCI may be unwelcome in naïve persons. Remedial causes of MCI should be actively investigated. Demographic and clinical characteristics of MCI differ between research subjects and patients referred to a tertiary care clinic.
Is cardiac sympathovagal modulation evaluated by short-term heart interval variability subtly impaired in Alzheimer 's disease?,"Data indicate that Alzheimer's disease subjects with mild-to-severe cognitive dysfunction showed subtle, absolute and relative parasympathetic depression and relative sympathetic exacerbation, which may even so contribute to distinctive functional and cognitive disturbances."
Does spray bacteriotherapy decrease middle ear fluid in children with secretory otitis media?,This study shows that spray treatment with S sanguinis may be effective against SOM. The mechanism for the effect remains to be investigated.
Are posterior hippocampal volumes associated with remission rates in patients with major depressive disorder?,"These findings extend a small number of previous reports, suggesting that regional brain volumes might be associated with rate and extent of clinical response to antidepressant medication."
Does motor sequence learning increase sleep spindles and fast frequencies in post-training sleep?,"These results provide evidence that sleep spindles are involved in the offline consolidation of a new sequence of finger movements known to be sleep dependent. Moreover, they expand on prior findings by showing that changes in NREM sleep following motor learning are specific to consolidation (and learning), and not to nonspecific motor activity. Finally, these data demonstrate, for the first time, higher fast rhythms (beta frequencies) during sleep after motor learning."
Is early morning executive functioning during sleep deprivation compromised by a PERIOD3 polymorphism?,This PER3 polymorphism differentially influences the effects of sleep deprivation on executive and non-executive function in the early morning. These effects appear to be mediated through homeostatic sleep pressure.
Does serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ) transporter inhibition cause bone loss in adult mice independently of estrogen deficiency?,"These data indicate that a commonly prescribed SSRI has a negative influence on the adult skeleton, independent of estrogen deficiency. This finding supports clinical data demonstrating SSRI use to be associated with accelerated bone loss after menopause and highlights a need for further research into the skeletal effects of SSRIs."
Is fibromuscular differentiation in deeply infiltrating endometriosis a reaction of resident fibroblasts to the presence of ectopic endometrium?,"FM differentiation in deeply infiltrating endometriosis is the result of a reaction of the local environment to the presence of ectopic endometrium. It shares characteristics with pathological wound healing, but cannot be explained by TGF-beta signaling alone."
Is pulse wave analysis a reproducible technique for measuring central blood pressure during hemodynamic perturbations induced by exercise?,"Radial tonometry is a reproducible technique for measurement of central waveform indices during perturbations induced by exercise. It should, therefore, be suitable for use in intervention studies in which hemodynamics are altered."
Does ultrasound imaging accurately identify the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve?,Identification of the LFCN by ultrasound is technically feasible and more accurate than anatomical landmarks.
Are levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A165b ( VEGF-A165b ) elevated in experimental glaucoma?,"Five day elevation of IOP leads to an increase in the anti-angiogenic VEGF-A165b levels but not in the pro-angiogenic VEGF-A164 levels in the glaucomatous retina. VEGF-A165b levels return to baseline after 10 days of elevated IOP, and VEGF-A164 levels remain unchanged. We speculate that the short-term elevation of VEGF-A165b levels and/or the unchanged levels of VEGF-A164 contribute to the lack of neovascularization in the glaucomatous retina."
Does reduction in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity result in the improvement of exercise capacity in mice with chronic heart failure?,Allosteric modification of hemoglobin represents a therapeutic option for improving exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure. One mechanism of improvement in exercise capacity is enhanced oxygen delivery in the skeletal muscle.
Is beat-to-beat QT interval variability primarily affected by the autonomic nervous system?,Beat-to-beat QT interval variability is affected by drugs that modulate the autonomic nervous system.
Does modulation of serotonin transporter function during fetal development cause dilated heart cardiomyopathy and lifelong behavioral abnormalities?,"These results indicate that prenatal fluoxetine exposure affects fetal development, resulting in cardiomyopathy and a higher vulnerability to affective disorders in a dose-dependent manner."
Do an update on digital photography for the general dental practitioner?,"This article will keep practitioners updated on the equipment available, and make the choice of equipment easier."
Do horizontal gene transfers link a human MRSA pathogen to contagious bovine mastitis bacteria?,"EvoPrinter analysis reveals that the human MRSA252 strain uniquely shares multiple DNA sequence blocks with different causative agents of bovine mastitis, suggesting that HGT events may be occurring between these pathogens. These findings have important implications with regard to animal husbandry practices that inadvertently enhance the contact of human and livestock bacterial pathogens."
Is down-regulation of NR4A1 in follicular thyroid carcinomas restored following lithium treatment?,"NR4A1 is under-expressed in most of FTCs. The loss of expression of both NR4A1 and the Wnt pathway gene FOSB was correlated with malignancy. This is consistent with the hypothesis that its loss of expression is part of the transformation process of FTCs, either as a direct or indirect consequence of Wnt pathway alterations. Lithium restores NR4A1 expression, induces apoptosis and reduces cell growth. These findings may explain a possible molecular mechanism of lithium's therapeutic action."
Are reference limits of serum TSH and free T4 significantly influenced by race and age in an urban outpatient medical practice?,Reference limits for TSH differ between races and with age. Use of race- and age-specific reference limits decreases misclassification of patients with lowered or raised TSH in an urban practice. The unique fT4:TSH relationships of blacks and whites may be genetically determined. The implications of the small decrement in fT4 as TSH increases remain to be explored.
Does genome-wide association analysis in sarcoidosis and Crohn 's disease unravel a common susceptibility locus on 10p12.2?,"Our study demonstrates that the combined analysis of different, albeit clinically related, phenotypes can lead to the identification of common susceptibility loci."
Are quantitative assessment of core/penumbra mismatch in acute stroke : CT and MR perfusion imaging strongly correlated when sufficient brain volume is imaged?,"Advanced MR and CT perfusion imaging measurements of core/penumbra mismatch for patient selection in stroke trials are highly correlated when CT perfusion coverage is sufficient to include most of the ischemic region. Although MR is currently the preferred imaging method for determining core and penumbra, CT perfusion is comparable and potentially more available."
Is impaired left ventricular energy metabolism in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy related to the extension of fibrosis at delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging?,This study demonstrated that the known alteration of the PCr/ATP-ratio observed in HCM patients is correlated with the presence of fibrotic areas in the myocardium of the left ventricle.
Does pathological tumour diameter predict risk of conventional subtype in small renal cortical tumours?,"There was a positive association between RCT diameter and the risk of having conventional renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Given that RCC histological subtype is a prognostic indicator for outcome, these findings may be applied in the selection of treatment options. Further studies investigating tumour size and other variables predictive of tumour histology will help clinicians better predict the RCC subtype."
Is minimally invasive thyroid and parathyroid surgery a question of length of the incision?,"Thyroid and parathyroid operations that minimize the incision but keep it in the neck may be considered minimally invasive not only in respect of the size of the skin incision but also, and above all, in respect of the accessibility of the operative field and extent of dissection. These operations have some advantages over conventional cervicotomy in terms of postoperative pain and cosmetic results. Until now, there is no evidence to state that morbidity of these new approaches is at least equal to the conventional equivalent. Operations that employ an extracervical approach, which have the advantage of leaving no scar in the neck, cannot reasonably be described as minimally invasive, as they require more dissection than conventional open surgery."
Does maternal glucose tolerance status influence the risk of macrosomia in male but not in female fetuses?,There is sexual dimorphism in the risk of abnormal birth weight attributed to maternal glucose tolerance status. A closer surveillance of foetal growth might be warranted in pregnant women with abnormal glucose tolerance carrying a male fetus.

Is neuropsychological impairment in severe acute viral hepatitis due to minimal hepatic encephalopathy?,MHE occurs in 25% of patients with AVH and resolves on follow up with recovery of AVH. Raised arterial ammonia during the icteric phase is associated with development of MHE.
"Are phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB involved in upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 by tumour necrosis factor-alpha?","These data suggest that TNF-alpha/TNF-R1 interaction leads to the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and p38MAPK and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, which is closely associated with the production and activation of MMP-9 in cultured CC cells of HuCTT-1 and CCKS-1. Upregulation of MMP-9 with NF-kappaB activation may be involved in the tumour invasion of CC."
Does admission C-reactive protein predict functional outcomes in patients with strokes in a subacute rehabilitation unit?,Serum CRP level does not predict functional outcome at discharge on inpatient rehabilitation for stroke.
Is fatigue resistance during a voluntary performance task associated with lower levels of mobility in cerebral palsy?,"Even after adjusting for maximum peak torque, the knee flexors and extensors of participants with CP were observed to be less fatigable than age-matched peers without motor disability. The lower rate of muscle fatigue was also associated with lower functional mobility in CP. These results may be related to strength or activation differences and/or muscle property alterations. Future investigations are warranted."

Does mutation analysis identify GUCY2D as the major gene responsible for autosomal dominant progressive cone degeneration?,"GUCY2D is a major gene responsible for progressive autosomal dominant cone degeneration. All identified mutations localize to codon 838. Haplotype analysis indicates that in most cases these mutations arise independently. Thus, codon 838 is likely to be a mutation hotspot in the GUCY2D gene."
Are higher serum vitamin D3 levels associated with better cognitive test performance in patients with Alzheimer 's disease?,"These data support the idea that a relationship exists between vitamin D status and cognition in patients with probable AD. However, given the cross-sectional design of this study, no causality can be concluded. Further prospective studies are needed to specify the contribution of vitamin D status to the onset and course of cognitive decline and AD."
Do proximal and distal colorectal cancers show distinct gene-specific methylation profiles and clinical and molecular characteristics?,These data showed that proximal and distal colorectal cancers have distinct gene-specific methylation profiles and molecular and clinical characteristics.
Does calorie restriction modulate inactivity-induced changes in the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein and pentraxin-3?,Calorie restriction prevents the inflammatory response induced by 14 d of bed rest. We suggest an inverse regulation of CRP and PTX3 in response to changes in energy balance.
Does cannabinoid type 1 receptor blockade promote mitochondrial biogenesis through endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in white adipocytes?,"CB1 receptor blockade increases mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipocytes by inducing the expression of eNOS. This is linked to the prevention of high-fat diet-induced fat accumulation, without concomitant changes in food intake."
Does cardiomyocyte expression of a polyglutamine preamyloid oligomer cause heart failure?,The data confirm the hypothesis that expression of an exogenous PAO-forming peptide is toxic to cardiomyocytes and is sufficient to cause cardiomyocyte loss and heart failure in a murine model.
Does repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation decrease the number of seizures in patients with focal neocortical epilepsy?,"We conclude that 2 weeks of rTMS at 0.5Hz with a figure-of-eight coil placed over the epileptic focus, determined with VARETA, decreases the number of seizures in patients with focal epilepsy, without reduction in IEDs."
Is meconium in the amniotic fluid of pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of membranes associated with early onset neonatal sepsis?,The presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid of pregnancies complicated by PPROM is associated with an increased incidence of early onset neonatal group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GBBS) sepsis.
Does bioelectric impedance spectroscopy underestimate fat-free mass compared to dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in incurable cancer patients?,"BIS by standard equations grossly underestimates FFM compared to DXA in cancer patients. This bias is related to weight loss, malnutrition and systemic inflammation. Revised equations improved FFM estimates, but with large individual variation. Thus, BIS with standard equations is not suitable to estimate FFM in patients with cachexia, inflammation and malnutrition."
Does candesartan inhibit Toll-like receptor expression and activity both in vitro and in vivo?,"Pam3CSK4 and LPS induced TLR2 and TLR4 expression at mRNA and protein levels are inhibited by candesartan both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we define a novel pathway by which candesartan could induce anti-inflammatory effects."
Is recurrence of major depressive disorder predicted by inhibited startle magnitude while recovered?,"This study has a relatively small sample size that limits the degree to which a thorough co-variant analysis can be conducted and also makes the analysis of gender-based difference impracticable. Additionally, as no healthy control group is included, we report a relative rather than absolute attenuation of startle to be indicative of symptom severity and recurrence proclivity."
Do self-esteem and social well-being of children with cochlear implant compared to normal-hearing children?,Children with cochlear implant score equal to or better than their normal-hearing peers on matters of self-esteem and social well-being.
Does [ Shikonin inhibit the proliferation of human airway smooth muscle cells ]?,Shikonin can inhibit the proliferation of HASMCs in vitro.
Is b-type natriuretic peptide a sensitive screening test for acute rejection in pediatric heart transplant patients?,"BNP levels have a high sensitivity and NPV for evaluating AR in pediatric heart transplant patients. In patients >1 year post-transplant, a BNP level of <100 pg/ml correlates with a <1% chance of AR and may obviate the need for EMB in some cases."
Does the ventilatory classification system effectively predict hospitalization in patients with heart failure?,"This study indicates that the VC system, based on the VE/VCO2 slope, effectively identifies patients with HF at varying degrees of risk for cardiac-related hospitalization. Furthermore, this newly developed system prognostically outperformed the established Weber classification system based on peak oxygen uptake."
Is behavioral stress affected by the mode of tube feeding in very low birth weight infants?,"This trial suggests that continuous feeding is associated with lower behavioral stress response as compared with bolus feeding among very low birth weight infants, in early postnatal life."
Does gefitinib ( Iressa ) potentiate the effect of ionizing radiation in thyroid cancer cell lines?,Inactivation of the EGFR kinase by Gefitinib potentiates the ionizing radiation-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in thyroid cancer cell lines. Use of this combination treatment of Gefitinib and ionizing radiation may be a promising therapy for anaplastic thyroid and metastatic follicular thyroid cancer and should be extended into animal models.

Does protein microarray analysis identify human cellular prion protein interactors?,"Protein microarray is a useful tool for systematic screening and comprehensive profiling of the human PrPC interactome. Because the network of PrPC and interactors involves signalling pathways essential for regulation of cell survival, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, these observations suggest a logical hypothesis that dysregulation of the PrPC interactome might induce extensive neurodegeneration in prion diseases."
Do bevacizumab and rapamycin induce growth suppression in mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma?,"Bevacizumab and rapamycin, which are both clinically approved drugs, may represent a novel molecularly-targeted combination treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma."
Are somatic FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations present in familial seborrhoeic keratoses?,"The results show that this case of familial SK reveals the same mutational spectrum as sporadic SK. Because FGFR3 and PIK3CA germline mutations can be excluded as an underlying genetic basis, alternative mechanisms have to contribute to familial SK such as inherited susceptibility factors predisposing to the acquisition of somatic FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations in skin, or increased exposure of the family members to yet unknown environmental risk factors causing these mutations."
"Does sitagliptin , an dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor , alter the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea , glyburide , in healthy subjects?",Sitagliptin does not alter the pharmacokinetics of glyburide in healthy subjects.
Does plasma pro-adrenomedullin but not plasma pro-endothelin predict survival in exacerbations of COPD?,"This study shows that plasma proADM but not plasma proET-1 on admission to the hospital for acute exacerbation independently predicts survival, thus suggesting that this biomarker could be used to predict prognosis in patients with COPD."
Does a significant increase in breathing amplitude precede sleep bruxism?,"To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that RMMA-SB muscle activity is associated with a rise in respiration within arousal."
Are cysteinyl leukotriene receptors expressed by tonsillar T cells of children with obstructive sleep apnea?,Tonsils of children with SDB but not of control subjects have enhanced expression of cysteinyl leukotriene receptors in T lymphocytes without an associated increase in serum CRP concentration. Up-regulation of LT1-R and LT2-R could potentially promote tonsillar enlargement in children with obstructive sleep apnea.
Do melanocyte precursors express elastin binding protein and elastin-derived peptide ( VGVAPG ) stimulates their melanogenesis and dendrite formation?,Melanocyte precursors expressed EBP. VGVAPG stimulated their melanogenesis and dendrite formation. In the developmental journey interaction between elastin and EBP-expressed melanocyte precursors in embryos happened mainly since the stage of tertiary melanoblasts. These findings first provide biological evidences for the interaction between melanocyte and elastic fiber.

Do individual mRNA expression profiles reveal the effects of specific microRNAs?,We have demonstrated that the effect of a miRNA on its target mRNAs' levels can be measured within a single gene expression profile. This emphasizes the extent of this mode of regulation in vivo and confirms that many of the predicted miRNA-mRNA interactions are correct. The success of this approach has revealed the vast potential for extracting information about miRNA function from gene expression profiles.
Is high mobility group AT-hook 1 ( HMGA1 ) an independent prognostic factor and novel therapeutic target in pancreatic adenocarcinoma?,"The current findings suggested that HMGA1 is an independent predictor of poor postoperative survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, HMGA1 promotes tumorigenicity through a PI3-K/Akt-dependent mechanism. HMGA1 warrants further evaluation as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer."
Is alpha-Hemoglobin stabilizing protein a suitable marker for a screening test for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,We conclude that quantitation of AHSP is not likely to be useful for detection of preclinical prion disease in man.
Does preoperative weight gain predict failure of weight loss or co-morbidity resolution of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity?,The results of our study have shown that weight loss before laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is not mandatory and might deter patients from considering weight loss surgery. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can be performed safely with equivalent co-morbidity resolution and %EWL regardless of PWG or PWL.
Is physical activity associated with risk factors for chronic disease across adult women 's life cycle?,"Overall, these results indicate that younger age and greater physical activity, despite age, are associated with fewer risk factors for chronic disease, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity."
Does hydroxypropyl-guar gellable lubricant eye drop for dry eye treatment?,"By being pH sensitive, Systane adapts its viscosity to the ocular surface pH, which tends to be higher in dry eye. It becomes more viscous when the eye is drier, thus, providing better ocular surface protection. In addition, its characteristics reduce ocular surface friction, which is another factor that exacerbates dry eye symptoms. Data published so far show that it is also well tolerated by the patient, thus, significantly reducing dry eye symptoms and improving the patient's quality of life. By implementing this novel approach, Systane has contributed significantly to dry eye treatment."
Does [ Hydrocamptothecin promote the mRNA expression of Wnt signaling inhibitor DKK-1 ]?,"Hydrocamptothecin promotes mRNA expression of Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor DKK-1 in Hep3B, HepG2, LoVo and U251 cells."
Do doctors and nurses on wards with greater access to clinical dietitians have better focus on clinical nutrition?,The present study shows that doctors and nurses on wards with greater access to clinical dietitians had better focus on clinical nutrition.
Is brain tissue oxygen tension more indicative of oxygen diffusion than oxygen delivery and metabolism in patients with traumatic brain injury?,Measurements of P(bt)O2 represent the product of CBF and the cerebral AVTO2 rather than a direct measurement of total oxygen delivery or cerebral oxygen metabolism. This improved understanding of the cerebral physiology of P(bt)O2 should enhance the clinical utility of brain tissue oxygen monitoring in patients with TBI.

Do patterns of cytokine profiles differ with pregnancy outcome and ethnicity?,Correlation analyses of cytokine measurements suggest coordinated interplay during pregnancy; significant differences exist between African Americans and Caucasians. Such analyses can serve as a means of understanding risk factors in these populations.
Is the development of atopic dermatitis independent of Immunoglobulin E up-regulation in the K14-IL-4 SKH1 transgenic mouse model?,"K14-IL-4-Tg/SKH1 mice developed skin inflammation that resembled human intrinsic atopic dermatitis. Therefore, this model may be suitable to study the pathogenesis of intrinsic atopic dermatitis."
Do alternative contingency table measures improve the power and detection of multifactor dimensionality reduction?,"Of the 10 measures evaluated, the likelihood ratio and normalized mutual information (NMI) are measures that consistently improve the detection and power of MDR in simulated data over using classification error. These measures also reduce the inclusion of spurious variables in a multi-locus model. Thus, MDR, which has already been demonstrated as a powerful tool for detecting gene-gene interactions, can be improved with the use of alternative fitness functions."
Do general anesthetics induce apoptotic neurodegeneration in the neonatal rat spinal cord?,"Anesthesia induces apoptosis in the neonatal rat spinal cord; however, the functional consequences of this injury, if any, remain obscure. Neither motor nor nociceptive responses were affected by anesthetic treatment. Nonetheless, further investigation is required as regional anesthetic techniques may also trigger neuroapoptosis in the spinal cord with unknown potency."

Do global considerations in hierarchical clustering reveal meaningful patterns in data?,"Although currently rarely used, global approaches, in particular, TD or glocal algorithms, should be considered in the exploratory process of clustering. In general, applying unsupervised clustering methods can leverage the quality of manually-created mapping of proteins families. As demonstrated, it can also provide insights in erroneous and missed annotations."
Does nicotine in breast milk influence heart rate variability in the infant?,Postnatal exposure to nicotine influences autonomic cardiovascular control in infants.
"Are consumption of fruit , vegetables , sweets and soft drinks associated with psychological dimensions of eating behaviour in parents and their 12-year-old children?","Psychological dimensions of eating behaviour are associated with patterns of food intake, in particular for consumption of sweets, and are most prominent in the parents. The children's food intake mirrored their parents' intake. Being sensitive to external food cues may increase unhealthy food consumption in our society, whereas more restrained eating may indicate proneness or intention to healthier food choices among parents. Emotional eating may imply a proneness to consume sweets for comfort, in particular among mothers."
Is totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair a safe option in patients with previous lower abdominal surgery?,"TEP repair is feasible in patients with previous lower abdominal surgery. TEP was planned as a day-case procedure; however, patients with recurrent hernias needed a planned admission, as an overnight stay was required."

However, their presence within the GPi may reduce the efficacy of DBS treatment."
Do polymethylmethacrylate particles stimulate bone resorption of mature osteoclasts in vitro?,"Treatment of mature osteoclasts with PMMA particles resulted in an elevated number of TRAP-positive cells. This persisted over a longer period of time than at the other stages of osteoclast development, and there was also a greater increase in bone resorption."
Do baseline scintigraphic abnormalities by myocardial perfusion imaging predict echocardiographic response to cardiac resynchronization therapy in nonischemic cardiomyopathy?,The presence of significant myocardial perfusion defects negatively influences echocardiographic response to CRT in NICM. These findings warrant prospective confirmation and histopathological correlation with explanted hearts.
Does varied access to intravenous methamphetamine self-administration differentially alter adult hippocampal neurogenesis?,"Intermittent (occasional access) and daily (limited and extended access) self-administration of methamphetamine impact different aspects of neurogenesis, the former producing initial pro-proliferative effects and the latter producing downregulating effects. These findings suggest that altered hippocampal integrity by even modest doses of methamphetamine could account for pronounced pathology linked to methamphetamine abuse."
Does presence of the metabolic syndrome in obese adolescents predict impaired glucose tolerance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease?,Abnormal glucose regulation and evidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were more common in subjects meeting three criteria for MS than in those meeting fewer criteria. The identification of MS provides value to the primary care provider. Those patients meeting criteria for MS should be evaluated for glucose intolerance and NAFLD.
Is the transcription factor Nfix essential for normal brain development?,"These data show that Nfix is essential for normal brain development and may be required for neural stem cell homeostasis. The delays seen in eye and ear opening and the brain morphology defects appear independent of the nutritional deprivation, as rescue of perinatal lethality with soft dough does not eliminate these defects."
Does the comparative ability of eight functional mobility tests for predicting fall in community-dwelling older people?,"the mobility tests appear to be measuring a similar 'mobility' construct. Based on feasibility and predictive validity, the AST, STS-5 and SMWTs were the best tests."
Is history of simple febrile seizures associated with hippocampal abnormalities in adults?,A history of simple FS in childhood can be associated with hippocampal abnormalities in adults. These abnormalities are probably more pronounced in men. Simple FS may not be as a benign event as previously thought. Our findings suggest that hippocampal abnormalities associated with FS are not necessarily epileptogenic.
Does angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist reduce bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice?,Both AT1 and AT2 are involved in promoting interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis via different mechanisms of action.
Are differences in low back pain behavior reflected in the cerebral response to tactile stimulation of the lower back?,"Successful adjustment to cLBP is associated with a patient's ability to effectively engage a sensory modulation system. In patients in whom such activation does not occur, subjective lack of control maypredispose to altered affective and behavioral responses with poor adjustment to pain. Pain experience may be furthermodified by reorganization of somatosensory cortex, contributing to maintenance of the chronic pain state."
Do pediatric illness severity measures predict delirium in a pediatric intensive care unit?,"Given the relatively low incidence of delirium, a low detection rate biased toward the most severe cases cannot be excluded."
Do early electrophysiologic markers predict functional outcome associated with temperature manipulation after cardiac arrest in rats?,The enhanced recovery provided by hypothermia and the detrimental effect by hyperthermia were robustly detected by early quantitative electroencephalographic markers. IQ values during the first 2 hrs after cardiac arrest accurately predicted neurologic outcome at 72 hrs.
Does major weight loss prevent long-term left atrial enlargement in patients with morbid and extreme obesity?,Change in body weight is associated with change in LA size independent of obesity-associated co-morbidities. Successful WL induced by bariatric surgery prevents the progressive increase in LA volume.
Does family history of suicidal behavior predict impulsive-aggressive behavior levels in psychiatric outpatients?,Retrospective design and family-history methodology; Limited sample; Contagion and imitation effects could not be assessed based on available data.
Does transcriptome analysis reveal new insight into appressorium formation and function in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae?,We present the first comprehensive genome-wide transcript profile study and functional analysis of infection structure formation by a fungal plant pathogen. Our data provide novel insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms that will directly benefit efforts to identify fungal pathogenicity factors and aid the development of new disease management strategies.
Do depressive symptoms combined with dementia affect 12-months survival in elderly patients after rehabilitation post-hip fracture surgery?,The co-occurrence of depression and dementia significantly increases the 12-months risk of dying in elderly patients after rehabilitation post-HF surgery.
Is radiation an important component of multimodality therapy for pediatric non-pineal supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors?,"Up-front RT and gross total resection may confer a survival benefit in patients with sPNET. Local failure was the dominant pattern of recurrence. Efforts should be made to determine patients most likely to have local failure exclusively or as a first recurrence, in order to delay or eliminate craniospinal irradiation."
Are [ Protein compositions in the seminal plasma similar between severe oligospermic and healthy fertile men ]?,"The finger prints of the seminal plasma proteins of the severe oligospermic group were similar to those of the healthy fertile males, both significantly different from the non-obstructive azoospermic men. It is suggested that pathogenesis mechanisms differ exist between non-obstructive azoospermia and severe oligospermia but are not the simple accumulation of genetic factors."
Is dengue in travellers still underestimated?,"These data imply that the risk for travellers to acquire DF has been underestimated. Nevertheless, dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are still rare in travellers, but those with a history of dengue should be advised to protect themselves well from mosquitoes when travelling to endemic areas."
Does angiotensin II type 1 receptor signaling contribute to synaptophysin degradation and neuronal dysfunction in the diabetic retina?,"These data indicate the first molecular evidence of the RAS-induced synaptophysin degradation and neuronal dysfunction in the diabetic retina, suggesting the possibility of the AT1R blockade as a novel neuroprotective treatment for diabetic retinopathy."
Does analysis by siRNA_profile program display novel thermodynamic characteristics of highly functional siRNA molecules?,"Low general stability of dsRNA plays a significant role in the RNAi pathway and is a recommended criterion to consider, in addition to 5'-instability, internal instability, nucleotide preferences and target mRNA position, when designing highly efficient siRNAs."
Does maternal environment influence cocaine intake in adulthood in a genotype-dependent manner?,Our experimental approach could contribute to the identification of the psychobiological factors determining the susceptibility or the resilience of certain individuals to develop psychopathologies.
Are platelet reactivity and clopidogrel resistance associated with the H2 haplotype of the P2Y12-ADP receptor gene?,This is the first large study in clopidogrel treated patients suggesting that a homozygote H2 genotype contributes to clopidogrel resistance. The clinical significance of this finding remains to be demonstrated.
Are fatty acid ethyl esters in meconium associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes to two years of age?,FAEE in meconium may be a marker for identifying newborns at risk for neurodevelopmental delay from alcohol exposure in utero.
Is functional Wnt signaling increased in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"Our study demonstrates that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is expressed and operative in adult lung epithelium. Increased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling may be involved in epithelial cell injury and hyperplasia, as well as impaired epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk in IPF. Thus, modification of Wnt signaling may represent a therapeutic option in IPF."
Is nephrogenic systemic fibrosis associated with transforming growth factor beta and Smad without evidence of renin-angiotensin system involvement?,We did not perform our studies on a cohort of comparable patients with renal dysfunction without NSF. Our technique may not have been sufficiently sensitive to detect renin-angiotensin system involvement.
Do [ Video urodynamic update of the vesicoureteral reflux classification in children ]?,"The usefulness of the classification is demonstrated, with the introduction of some modifications necessary for its continuous updating."
Is the effect of birthweight upon insulin resistance and associated cardiovascular risk factors in adolescence explained by fetal growth velocity in the third trimester as measured by repeated ultrasound fetometry?,"In the present study, FGV did not explain the impact of birthweight upon the metabolic phenotype in adolescence. This suggests that fetal growth prior to the third trimester or postnatal catch-up growth plays a more important role."
Do brain responses to verbal stimuli among multiple sclerosis patients with pseudobulbar affect?,"PBA of MS patients involves cortical structures related to sensory-motor and emotional processing, in addition to overactive involvement of motor cortical areas in response to neutral stimuli."
Is section modulus the optimum geometric predictor for stress fractures and medial tibial stress syndrome in both male and female athletes?,"The results show that in men, the cross-sectional area and the section modulus are the key parameters in the tibia to distinguish exercise and injury status, whereas for women, it is the section modulus only."
Is outcome of pregnancies at risk for neonatal hemochromatosis improved by treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin?,"Neonatal hemochromatosis seems to be the result of a gestational alloimmune disease, and occurrence of severe neonatal hemochromatosis in at-risk pregnancies can be significantly reduced by treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin during gestation."
Is stroke volume increase to exercise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease limited by increased pulmonary artery pressure?,"As a consequence of unaltered pulmonary vascular resistance to exercise in COPD patients, Ppa increases and SV response to exercise is limited and results from an increased preload only. Ppa at rest predicts exercise SV."
Is body composition associated with physical activity in daily life as measured using a triaxial accelerometer in both men and women?,"Evidence was found for an association between body composition and physical activity in both genders. A consistent year-round degree of physical activity appears to be a prerequisite to reveal the association. Moreover, Tracmor-assessed physical activity improves the estimate of %BF when a participant's characteristics are taken into account."
Is appendiceal fecalith associated with early perforation in pediatric patients?,The presence of fecalith is associated with earlier and higher rates of appendiceal perforation in pediatric patients with acute appendicitis. An expedient appendectomy should therefore be performed in the pediatric patient with a radiologic evidence of fecalith.
Is a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human ITGB3 gene associated with the platelet-specific alloantigen Va ( HPA-17bw ) involved in fetal maternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia?,"With the use of a combination of DNA sequencing and recombinant antigen expression, the molecular basis of the PLT-specific Va(a) antigen (HPA-17bw), a low-frequency antigen implicated in FMAIT, has been resolved. These data further demonstrate the value of using recombinant beta3 peptides for the detection of rare but clinically relevant antibodies."

Does gene expression study of Aurora-A reveal implication during bladder carcinogenesis and increasing values in invasive urothelial cancer?,"This study highlights the fact that Aurora-A gene expression is already strongly deregulated in early stages of urothelial carcinoma with abnormal expression, and might be considered a biomarker of tumor aggression. The increase in Aurora-A expression might provide further information regarding the behavior of bladder cancer in daily practice."
Does functional magnetic resonance imaging reveal neuroanatomical dissociations during semantic integration in schizophrenia?,"As meaning is built from language, schizophrenia patients demonstrate a neuroanatomical dissociation in the modulation of temporal/inferior frontal cortices and the DLPFC."
Is why it difficult to detect an illegally bowled cricket delivery with either the naked eye or usual two-dimensional video analysis?,"It is impossible for an umpire conclusively to cite a bowler for an illegal action based only on naked eye observation. To do this the umpire would need to be in at least three different positions throughout a single delivery. Similarly, video footage shot from at least three different angles during the bowler's delivery action would need to be viewed by the match referee. By viewing the delivery from only one position, the visual illusion of a ""throw"" will be created by the presence of a large ""carrying angle""."
Does epiaortic scanning modify planned intraoperative surgical management but not cerebral embolic load during coronary artery bypass surgery?,These results show that the use of EAS led to modifications in intraoperative surgical management in almost one-third of patients undergoing CABG surgery. The use of EAS did not lead to a reduced number of TCD-detected cerebral emboli before or during CPB.

Is breakfast cereal associated with a lower prevalence of obesity among 10-12-year-old children : the PANACEA study?,"These data provide evidence that breakfast cereal as a most frequent choice, and daily consumption of breakfast, are inversely associated with the prevalence of overweight or obesity in 10-12-year-old children."
Does contingency management reduce drug-related human immunodeficiency virus risk behaviors in cocaine-abusing methadone patients?,These results suggest that CM treatment reduces HIV drug use risk behaviors in cocaine-abusing methadone maintenance patients.
Is somatostatin analog treatment associated with an increased sleep latency in patients with long-term biochemical remission of acromegaly?,"Daytime sleepiness is increased in a homogeneous cohort of patients in long-term remission from acromegaly. In addition, somatostatin analog treatment increases sleep latency and delays sleep onset in patients with long-term biochemical control of growth hormone overproduction without altering total sleep duration."
Is the rising incidence of type 1 diabetes accounted for by cases with lower-risk human leukocyte antigen genotypes?,"The rising incidence and decreasing age at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is accounted for by the impact of environment on children with lower-risk HLA class II genes, who previously would not have developed type 1 diabetes in childhood."
Is glomerular expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 predictive of poor renal prognosis in pediatric lupus nephritis?,There is a correlation between glomerular expression of MCP-1 and PGM1 and worsening renal prognosis in paediatric LN. Larger prospective studies of paediatric LN are required to further evaluate MCP-1 and other markers of disease progression.

Moreover, the loss of MAD1 protein expression may be related to the tumor recurrence after surgical resection of HCC."
Is partial compliance with antipsychotic medication common in patients with schizophrenia?,"Partial compliance is a common problem in schizophrenia. Strategies to improve partial compliance derived from the contributing factors identified in the present study may include regular telephone reminders by case managers or families, adequate support in the patients' environment, use of dosette boxes, rationalizing drug regimens (e.g. once-daily dosage, monotherapy, depot medication), and psychoeducation."
Does gene expression analysis provide a potential rationale for revising the histological grading of follicular lymphomas?,"These data support the hypothesis that grade IIIb follicular lymphoma does indeed belong to the group of follicular lymphomas rather than diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and also suggests a possible revision of the histological grading of follicular lymphomas, with their simple distinction into follicular lymphoma (grade I-IIIa) and follicular lymphoma/large cell (grade IIIb)."
Does peripheral repetitive magnetic stimulation induce intracortical inhibition in healthy subjects?,"rMS might therefore be used in rehabilitative strategies for spasticity, pain or central paresis."
Does [ Quality of spirometry test done in primary care units in the province of Gipuzkoa ]?,"Quality of spirometry tests in primary care is deficient. The most common error is that exhalation is too brief. We think this is why we find a predominance of restrictive patterns over obstructive ones. Just by prolonging the spirometry operation, we would manage to increase markedly the number of valid tests."
"Is cryptorchidism at birth in Nice area ( France ) associated with higher prenatal exposure to PCBs and DDE , as assessed by colostrum concentrations?",Our results support an association between congenital cryptorchidism and fetal exposure to PCBs and possibly DDE. Higher concentrations in milk could be a marker of higher exposure or for an impaired detoxification pattern in genetically predisposed individuals.
Are the four blastomeres of a 4-cell stage human embryo able to develop individually into blastocysts with inner cell mass and trophectoderm?,"Although based on a small number of embryos, we conclude that the blastomeres of a 4-cell stage human embryo are flexible and able to develop into blastocysts with ICM and TE."
Does tight contact technique during side-to-side laser tissue soldering of rabbit aortas improve tensile strength?,"These first results proved the importance of close and tight contact during the laser soldering procedure thus enabling the development of a ""sandwich laser irradiation device"" for in vivo application in the rabbit."
Do anaplastic oligodendrogliomas with 1p19q codeletion have a proneural gene expression profile?,"These findings provide evidence for neuronal differentiation in oligodendrogliomas with 1p19q codeletion and support the hypothesis that the cell of origin for gliomas with 1p19q codeletion could be a bi-potential progenitor cell, able to give rise to both neurons and oligodendrocytes."
Does real-time continuous glucose monitoring together with telemedical assistance improve glycemic control and glucose stability in pump-treated patients?,Real-time CGM in conjunction with the DIABTel system improves glycemic control and glucose stability in pump-treated patients with type 1 diabetes.
Is muSK-positive myasthenia gravis rare in the Polish population?,MuSK-positive MG is rare in Polish population accounting for only 8.7% of seronegative cases with generalized MG. This is consistent with emerging evidence for lower MuSK antibodies at more northerly latitudes.
Is pan-neurotrophin receptor p75NTR expression strongly induced in lesional atopic mast cells?,The demonstration of an increased level of p75NTR gene transcription in lesional mast cells points to an induction of low-affinity neurotrophin receptor sensitivity of mast cells under states of allergic inflammation. Topically administered neurotrophin receptor-modulating compounds may act as anti-inflammatory mediators in cutaneous allergic inflammation.
Is the top 10 reasons musculoskeletal sonography an important complementary or alternative technique to MRI?,Musculoskeletal sonography is an important complementary tool to MRI and is essential for radiologists who want to provide patients with state-of-the-art musculoskeletal imaging.
Is breast stromal enhancement on MRI associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy?,"These findings indicate that breast stroma tissue outside the incident tumor can be quantified using signal enhancement ratio analysis on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Stromal signal enhancement ratio is a potential indicator for response to treatment and for overall outcome in patients with breast cancer; however, these results should be validated in a prospective study."
Does elevated perioperative transaminase level predict intrahepatic recurrence in hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma after curative hepatectomy?,"An elevated perioperative ALT level, which reflects increased hepatitis activity, is an independent risk factor for intrahepatic recurrence of hepatitis B-related HCC. It is also associated with a poorer disease-free survival rate."
Is low socioeconomic status a risk factor for preeclampsia : the Generation R Study?,Low maternal socioeconomic status is a strong risk factor for preeclampsia. Only a small part of this association can be explained by the mediating effects of established risk factors for preeclampsia. Further research is needed to disentangle the pathway from low socioeconomic status to preeclampsia.
Do periapical radiographs overestimate root canal wall thickness during post space preparation?,"Throughout preparation for post placement, radiographic images overestimated the RCWT by approximately 25%, regardless of the clinical stage evaluated."

Is feeding induced by cannabinoids mediated independently of the melanocortin system?,Our results demonstrate that the effects of cannabinoids on energy balance are independent of hypothalamic melanocortin circuitry and is primarily driven by the reward system.
Does cystatin C improve the detection of mild renal dysfunction in older patients?,Serum cystatin C is a simple and sensitive screening test for kidney dysfunction in older people.
Do numbers of neurons in the retinal ganglion cell layer of the rat change throughout life?,"When rats are kept under standard conditions, there is no neuronal loss in the retina during aging, although the cell density does decrease as a result of retinal expansion. It is not sufficient to measure retinal cell density to determine cell loss. In addition, it is important to know that in normal conditions there is no cell loss in the retinal ganglion cell layer as a result of aging. Any loss that is seen must be a result of additional factors."
Does one size fit all : how the tobacco industry has altered cigarette design to target consumer groups with specific psychological and psychosocial needs?,Cigarette brands created to address the psychological/psychosocial needs of smokers may increase the likelihood of smoking initiation and addiction. Awareness of targeted product development will improve smoking cessation and prevention efforts.
"Are effects of a melanogenic bicyclic monoterpene diol on cell cycle , p53 , TNF-alpha , and PGE2 distinct from those of UVB?",This study shows that melanogenesis can be induced by AGI-1140 without many of the deleterious effects associated with UVB.
Is high-dose vasopressin superior to norepinephrine in septic shock?,"Vasopressin, in doses sufficient to replace the vasopressor norepinephrine, had mixed effects in septic shock patients. Hepatosplanchnic blood flow was preserved during substantial reduction in cardiac output. An increased gastric PCO2 gap suggests that the gut blood flow could have been redistributed to the disadvantage of the mucosa. Based on these limited data, it does not appear beneficial to directly replace norepinephrine with vasopressin in septic shock."
Do variations in case definition affect prevalence but not outcomes of mild cognitive impairment?,"Memory complaints and intact IADL may be unnecessary requirements for a case definition of MCI in population-based samples. The MCI criteria identify people at increased risk of AD, but the potential for improvement of a substantial proportion of those with MCI needs to be acknowledged."
Does training in tasks with different visual-spatial components improve virtual arthroscopy performance?,"One hour of training in different visual-spatial contexts was not enough to improve the performance in virtual arthroscopy tasks. It cannot be excluded, however, that experienced trainees could improve their performance, because perceived similarity between different situations is influenced by many psychological factors, such as the knowledge or expertise of the person performing the transfer task."
Does emergency department length of stay independently predict excess inpatient length of stay?,"EDLOS correlates strongly with IPLOS, and predicts whether IPLOS exceeds the state benchmark for the relevant diagnosis-related group, independently of elderly status, sex and time of presentation to ED. Strategies to reduce EDLOS (including countering access block) may significantly reduce healthcare expenditure and patient morbidity."
Does detection of rare disseminated tumor cells identify head and neck cancer patients at risk of treatment failure?,These findings suggest that detection of DTCs pre- or intraoperatively indicates a high risk of local and distant recurrence and reduced survival in head and neck cancer.
Are increased serum levels of interleukin 6 associated with severe intraventricular haemorrhage in extremely premature infants?,"Raised serum IL6 may serve as a marker for severe IVH in infants < 28 weeks of gestational age. Although cerebral morbidity in premature infants is determined by different variables, the identification of systemic inflammation can help to define the need for anti-inflammatory strategies to prevent cerebral morbidity."
Does partial meniscectomy in the presence of severe osteoarthritis hasten the symptomatic progression of osteoarthritis?,Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in the presence of Outerbridge grade IV degenerative change is likely to improve symptoms initially in patients with symptomatic meniscal tears and may provide lasting benefit. It does not appear to hasten the progression of the osteoarthritis in these patients.
Does helicobacter pylori induce cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in vascular endothelial cells?,"H. pylori increased both COX-1 and COX-2 activity in vascular endothelial cells. This increased generation of endothelial cell prostacyclin may play a role in modulating mucosal blood flow, platelet function and inflammatory cell infiltration in response to H. pylori infection. The regulation of COX-1 at the transcriptional level by H. pylori described in this study is a novel finding and calls into question the traditional description of COX-1 as a purely constitutive, housekeeping gene."
Does surgical outcome in mesial temporal sclerosis correlate with prion protein gene variant?,The PRNP variant allele Asn171Ser is highly prevalent in patients with medically untreatable MTLE-HS and influences their surgical outcome. The results suggest that the PRNP variant allele at codon 171 (Asn171Ser) is associated with epileptogenesis in MTLE-HS.
Do cytokine/chemokine transcript profiles reflect mucosal inflammation in Crohn 's disease?,Elevated proinflammatory cytokine transcripts in active CD may underlie disease reactivation and chronicity. Real-time PCR quantification is a simple and objective method for grading inflammation of intestinal mucosa and may be useful in identifying patients who would benefit from anti-inflammatory remission maintenance.
Do laser-assisted optical rotational cell analyzer measurements reveal early changes in human RBC deformability induced by photodynamic treatment?,LORCA measurements can effectively be used to detect changes in deformability that are induced by photodynamic treatment of human RBCs. A change in deformability represents an early marker of RBC damage under these conditions.
Does age-related variations in hematologic and plasma biochemical test result in Beagles and Labrador Retrievers?,"Results suggested that there were age-related changes in hematologic and plasma biochemical test results in these 2 breeds of dogs. Changes were most evident during the first year of life, reflecting growth and maturation of the puppies. In some instances, values for puppies diverged markedly from those for adults, necessitating the use of age-specific reference ranges for the interpretation of clinical data."
Is clinical onset and diagnosis of eating disorders in premenarcheal girls preceded by inadequate weight gain and growth retardation?,"Girls with eating disorders presenting before menarche may have a long history of poor weight gain and growth retardation before the onset of weight loss. This is in contrast to older girls, who commonly start weight loss at an above-average weight without prior poor weight gain. Since the psychopathology of ED in young girls may be different and less evident compared with older teenagers it is important to be aware that poor weight gain and growth retardation may be associated with early-onset ED."
Is open-access gastroscopy associated with improved outcomes in gastric cancer?,Gastric cancers presenting at OAG were diagnosed at an earlier stage than cancers diagnosed after conventional referral. This led to a higher proportion of potentially curative resections and better five-year survival.
Does standardization of occupational dose to patient DAP enable reliable assessment of radiation-protection devices in invasive cardiology?,"DAP-standardized dose parameters - determined experimentally (phantom measurements), or in routine clinical work - are not appreciably influenced by the equipment age and type, or by the image-intensifier entrance dose rate of the respective catheterization system. They are consequently best suited for obtaining eloquent comparisons of various radiation-protection devices, and for reliable estimation of local scatter radiation exposure by simple documentation of intervention DAP."
Does long-term intermittent exposure to high ambient CO2 cause respiratory disturbances during sleep in submariners?,"We conclude that during an 11-day cruise, submariners adapt to high CO(2) levels, as evidenced by the significant dependence of RDI on CO(2) during the final but not initial days of the cruise. This adaptation resulted in a significant increase in RDI when CO(2) levels declined during the later nights of the cruise."
Does prenatal stress diminish neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of juvenile rhesus monkeys?,"These findings indicate that the prenatal environment can alter behavior, dysregulate neuroendocrine systems, and affect the hippocampal structure of primates in a persistent manner."
Do total sialic acid levels decrease in the periventricular area of infantile rats with hydrocephalus?,"Sialic acid, a vital component of brain gangliosides, which play an essential role in the transmission and storage of information in the brain, was found to be significantly decreased in the periventricular area of hydrocephalic infantile rats."
Does early administration of antibiotics shorten time to clinical stability in patients with moderate-to-severe community-acquired pneumonia?,"The administration of antibiotics within 4 h does not reduce the TCS in adult patients with MTS-CAP, as defined by the PORT group. Future studies using other physiologic parameters should be explored."
Does new approach to the risk of Candida in the intensive care unit?,"Invasive candidiasis is a relevant problem in the intensive care setting. Better risk assessment strategies will permit identification of the subpopulations of patients that would benefit from prophylactic antifungal therapy the most, having the potential to save millions of lives and dollars."
Does functional imbalance of visual pathways indicate alternative face processing strategies in autism?,"The cortical activation pattern during face processing indicates deficits in the face-specific regions, with higher activations in regions involved in visual search. These findings reflect different strategies for visual processing, supporting models that propose a predisposition to local rather than global modes of information processing in autism."
Is a sensitive guaiac faecal occult blood test less useful than an immunochemical test for colorectal cancer screening in a Chinese population?,"The positive predictive value of the immunochemical faecal occult blood test for the detection of significant colorectal neoplasia was 29% better than that of the sensitive guaiac-based test. This may relate to the Chinese diet and requires further study. The poor specificity of the sensitive guaiac-based test, without dietary restriction, makes it less useful for colorectal cancer screening in a Chinese population."
Do lymphocytes endowed with colon-selective homing and engineered to produce TGF-beta1 prevent the development of dinitrobenzene sulphonic acid colitis?,We conclude that lymphocytes are an efficient vehicle for transient gene therapy and that cells bearing alpha4beta7 integrins preferentially deliver therapeutic genes to the colonic mucosa.
Is cell proximity a prerequisite for the proliferative response of bystander cells co-cultured with cells irradiated with gamma-rays?,"In the present experimental model, the spatial proximity of cells is a crucial element for transmitting growth stimulation signals from irradiated cells to neighboring unirradiated cells. Direct cell-to-cell contact appears to be required for transmitting these signals. Neither functional GJIC nor soluble extracellular factors released by irradiated cells into the culture medium appear to play significant roles in this process under the present experimental conditions."
Do determinants of hospital mortality of adult recipients of right lobe live donor liver transplantation?,"To achieve a uniformly successful right lobe LDLT, the right lobe graft must contain a patent middle hepatic vein. With a completely patent middle hepatic vein, a graft size of >35% of the estimated standard graft weight may be sufficient for recipient survival. Hypothermia, which predisposes to coagulopathy and is enhanced by the use of venovenous bypass and massive blood, and blood product transfusion must be avoided."
"Are climatic variables associated with seasonal acute asthma admissions to accident and emergency room facilities in Trinidad , West Indies?","There is seasonal variation in acute asthma visits to A&E facilities in Trinidad, which remains significant after controlling for climate variables. However, while climate has a role, there are other factors that may also be responsible for increased visits during the wet season. More research is needed to identify these factors."
Are lymphoma rates low but increased in patients with psoriasis : results from a population-based cohort study in the United Kingdom?,"These results indicate that patients with psoriasis are at increased risk for developing lymphoma. Additional studies are necessary to determine if the increased rate of lymphoma is related to psoriasis severity, psoriasis treatment, or an interaction between these risk factors."
Is silencing of CDKN1C ( p57KIP2 ) associated with hypomethylation at KvDMR1 in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome?,"An epimutation at KvDMR1, the absence of maternal methylation, causes the aberrant silencing of CDKN1C, some 180 kb away on the maternal chromosome. Similar to mutations at this locus, this silencing may give rise to BWS."
Does propofol inhibit neuronal firing activities in the caudal ventrolateral medulla?,The dose-dependent inhibition of the spontaneous neuronal firing rate is the main pharmacological action of propofol in the caudal ventrolateral medulla of cats.
Does three-dimensional in vitro culture of endometrial explants mimic the early stages of endometriosis?,"These data show that cells from endometrial explants can proliferate and invade a fibrin matrix in vitro generating new glands, stroma, and vessels consistent with endometriosis. The three-dimensional fibrin matrix used in the present study provides an opportunity to observe the earliest biological events of endometriosis in a quantifiable way."
Does framingham Heart Study risk equation predict first cardiovascular event rates in New Zealanders at the population level?,A Framingham Heart Study risk equation used to estimate incident cardiovascular events in individuals without previous cardiovascular disease accurately predicts five-year risk of hospitalisation or death from a first cardiovascular event in New Zealand men aged 35-74 and women aged 35-69 years at the population level.
Does recombinant human parathyroid hormone ( 1-34 ) [ teriparatide ] improve both cortical and cancellous bone structure?,"By 2D histomorphometric analyses, teriparatide significantly increased cancellous bone volume (median percent change: teriparatide, 14%; placebo, -24%; p = 0.001) and reduced marrow star volume (teriparatide, -16%; placebo, 112%; p = 0.004). Teriparatide administration was not associated with osteomalacia or woven bone, and there were no significant changes in mineral appositional rate or wall thickness. By 3D cancellous and cortical bone structural analyses, teriparatide significantly decreased the cancellous structure model index (teriparatide, -12%; placebo, 7%; p = 0.025), increased cancellous connectivity density (teriparatide, 19%; placebo, - 14%; p = 0.034), and increased cortical thickness (teriparatide, 22%; placebo, 3%; p = 0.012). These data show that teriparatide treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis significantly increased cancellous bone volume and connectivity, improved trabecular morphology with a shift toward a more plate-like structure, and increased cortical bone thickness. These changes in cancellous and cortical bone morphology should improve biomechanical competence and are consistent with the substantially reduced incidences of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures during administration of teriparatide."
Does aerobic endurance exercise improve executive functions in depressed patients?,A single 30-minute aerobic endurance exercise program performed by depressed patients has positive effects on executive control processes that appear to be specifically subserved by the anterior cingulate.
Is myocardial strain rate a superior method for evaluation of left ventricular subendocardial function compared with tissue Doppler imaging?,"Strain and SR appear useful and sensitive for evaluating myocardial function, especially for the subendocardial region."
"Is caenorhabditis elegans RBX1 essential for meiosis , mitotic chromosomal condensation and segregation , and cytokinesis?",These results indicate that the RBX1 protein participates in diverse functions relevant to chromosome metabolism and cell cycle control.
Does pupil dilatation do affect some aspects of daytime driving performance?,Pupil dilatation can impair selected aspects of driving and vision performance and patients should be cautioned about these possible effects.
Do electroconvulsive seizures induce proliferation of NG2-expressing glial cells in adult rat hippocampus?,Our results show that antidepressant treatment can induce a strong proliferation of glial progenitor cells in the adult rat hippocampus. We propose that this may counteract degenerative changes found in depression and be an important neurobiological event underlying the clinical effect of electroconvulsive seizures.
Is reduced cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus correlated with the development of learned helplessness?,"These results are in line with reports that the rate of dentate gyrus cell proliferation is acutely down-regulated by stress, but the development of helpless behavior does not correlate with this process. Further studies will have to clarify if during learned helpless behavior neurogenesis is impaired by altered differentiation or survival of cells."
Do the effect of small peer group continuous quality improvement on the clinical practice of midwives in The Netherlands?,Small group CQI had a positive effect on changing clinical practice when the learning of new skills (e.g. learning a new suturing technique) was not necessary. Additional interventions are needed when implementing guidelines that recommend the learning of new skills.
Is kangaroo care effective in diminishing pain response in preterm neonates?,"For preterm neonates who are 32 weeks' postmenstrual age or older, KC seems to effectively decrease pain from heel lancing. Further study is needed to determine if younger neonates or those requiring assistance in breathing, or older infants or toddlers, would benefit from KC, or if it would remain effective over several procedures. Given its effectiveness, and that parents of neonates in critical care units want to participate more in comforting their children, KC is a potentially beneficial strategy for promoting family health."
Is postoperative nadroparin administration for prophylaxis of thromboembolic events associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage after spinal surgery?,"Although retrospective, this is to date the largest study providing information about the hemorrhage rate associated with early postoperative anticoagulation following spinal surgery. The results confirm that early postoperative pharmacological thromboembolic prophylaxis using nadroparin in patients with spinal surgery is not associated with an increased risk of postoperative hemorrhage."
Is lDL cholesterol associated with small abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"The highly significant association between LDL cholesterol and small aneurysms suggests that LDL, possibly acting via inflammatory mediated matrix degeneration, could be an initiating factor in the development of AAA. The ability of statin therapy to prevent AAA formation requires further investigation."
Does bone density improve with disease remission in patients with inflammatory bowel disease?,"In patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, age-matched BMD is higher with increasing duration of disease remission and induction of remission by azathioprine."
Does prevalence and correlate of habitual snoring in high school students?,"These findings suggest that chronic habitual snoring is associated with multiple factors in adolescents. Whether interventions to modify BMI and smoking can alter snoring habits and related clinical problems warrants further study, particularly as it also may improve academic performance in high school students."
Are cortisol levels positively correlated with hippocampal N-acetylaspartate?,"This study shows a positive relationship between cortisol levels and hippocampal NAA in subjects without hypercortisolemia. Within the range of values seen in our subjects, cortisol may have a trophic effect on the hippocampus."
Is trauma exposure rather than posttraumatic stress disorder associated with reduced baseline plasma neuropeptide-Y levels?,Trauma exposure rather than posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with reduced baseline plasma neuropeptide-Y levels. Future studies must determine if neuropeptide-Y reactivity differentiates trauma-exposed individuals with and without posttraumatic stress disorder.
Is leukoaraiosis more than dementia a predictor of stroke recurrence?,"Dementia was not a predictor of stroke recurrence, but leukoaraiosis was strongly associated with stroke recurrence. Special attention in the secondary prevention of stroke must be given to patients with leukoaraiosis with or without dementia."
Does a simple risk score predict poor quality of life and non-survival at 1 year follow-up in dialysis patients?,"A simple risk score based on INTERMED, age (> or =65) and comorbid diabetes (yes/no) can be used to detect patients at risk of poor QoL and non-survival at an early stage of treatment."
Do genetic variants in Apolipoprotein AV alter triglyceride concentrations in pregnancy?,"In conclusion variation in the ApoAV gene raises triglyceride concentrations in pregnancy, as well as normolipaemic states and there is preliminary evidence that it alters fetal growth parameters."
Does transgene-derived hepatocyte growth factor attenuate reactive renal fibrosis in aristolochic acid nephrotoxicity?,"Circulating transgene-derived HGF (2-10 ng/ml) could not prevent tubular degeneration caused by AA, but attenuated interstitial fibrogenesis during tubular regeneration. These findings suggest a possible therapeutic efficacy for renal interstitial fibrosis following tubular degeneration even of low-dose HGF."
Is maturation of dendritic cells a prerequisite for inducing immune responses in advanced melanoma patients?,"We conclude that mature DC are superior to immature DC in the induction of immunological responses in melanoma patients, which may translate into improved clinical results."
Does endoscopic response predict for survival and organ preservation after primary chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer?,Endoscopic response after primary CRT for esophageal cancer was the most significant predictive factor for overall and disease-specific survival. Regular endoscopic surveillance after CRT achieved survival rates comparable to other strategies and successfully preserved the esophagus in the majority of patients who survived more than 2 years.
Does comparison of injuries in sow housed in gestation stalls versus group pens with electronic sow feeders?,Modifications in housing system design and management procedures are needed to reduce injuries in pregnant sows.
Are analytic global OSCE ratings sensitive to level of training?,"In this study, a summated analytic global rating demonstrated construct validity, as did 2 of the 4 scales measuring specific traits. In addition, the analytic global rating showed substantially higher internal consistency than did the checklists, a finding consistent with that seen in previous studies cited in the literature. Global ratings are an important element of OSCE measurement and can have good psychometric properties. However, OSCE researchers should clearly describe the type of global ratings they use. Further research is needed to define the most effective global rating scales."
Is expression of transforming growth factor beta1 in nerve fibers related to dysmenorrhea and laparoscopic appearance of endometriotic implants?,The physical appearance of endometriotic implants and the severity of dysmenorrhea appear to be related to the expression of TGFbeta1 in nerve fibers.
Does tumor size predict survival within stage IA non-small cell lung cancer?,These data suggest that size within stage IA is an important predictor of survival and that further substaging should be considered.
Does tumor perfusion rate determined noninvasively by dynamic computed tomography predict outcome in head-and-neck cancer after radiotherapy?,CT-determined tumor perfusion rate was found to be an independent predictor of local outcome in irradiated head-and-neck cancer. The results of this study confirm the hypothesis that less-perfused tumors respond poorly to radiotherapy.
Do transplants of cells engineered to produce GABA suppress spontaneous seizures?,These data demonstrate that genetically engineered cells have the ability to suppress spontaneous seizures when transplanted into seizure-modulating nuclei. This is an important step toward defining a clinical potential for this approach in epilepsy. The fact that the gene of interest can be regulated suggests that individualizing transplant therapy may be possible.
Does high-frequency vibration training increase muscle power in postmenopausal women?,Reflex muscular contractions induced by vibration training improve muscle power in postmenopausal women.
Is personality as assessed by egogram a possible independent predictive variable for post-discharge smoking abstinence in male cancer patients?,These findings indicate that a male cancer patient's personality as assessed by the egogram has predictive significance for whether the patient will have a smoking habit after discharge.
Do prostate carcinoma cells that have resided in bone have an upregulated IGF-I axis?,Our results suggest that PC cells that have metastasized to bone have an upregulated IGF-I regulatory system. This suggests an activated IGF-I axis contributes to the host-PC interaction in promoting osteoblastic metastases.
Does a continuous quality-improvement program reduce nosocomial infection rates in the ICU?,A continuous quality-improvement program based on surveillance of nosocomial infections in a nonselected medical-surgical ICU population was associated with sustained decreases in UTI and CVC-related infections.
"Is tbAGO1 , an argonaute protein required for RNA interference , involved in mitosis and chromosome segregation in Trypanosoma brucei?",The requirement of TbAGO1 for RNAi in trypanosomes demonstrates the evolutionary ancient involvement of Argonaute proteins in RNAi silencing processes. RNAi-deficient TbAGO1-/- cells showed numerous defects in chromosome segregation and mitotic spindle assembly. We propose a working hypothesis in which RNAi would be involved in heterochromatin formation at the centromere and therefore in chromosome segregation.
Does selective beta1-blockade attenuate post-infarct remodelling without improvement in myocardial energy metabolism and function in rats with heart failure?,"Selective beta1-blockade in rats with chronic CHF attenuates post-infarct structural remodelling, without concomitant improvement in myocardial energy metabolism and function. Improvements in myocardial energy metabolism and function do not precede and are not a prerequisite for an anti-remodelling effect of beta1-blockade in the setting of chronic CHF."
Do neuropeptide-Y Y5 receptors modulate the onset and maintenance of operant ethanol self-administration?,"These results indicate that blockade NPY Y5 receptor activity modulates the onset and maintenance of ethanol self-administration. For this reason, NPY-Y5 receptor antagonists may be useful in medical management of alcohol abuse and alcoholism."
Does adolescent exposure to methylphenidate alter the activity of rat midbrain dopamine neurons?,Adolescent exposure to methylphenidate induces neuronal changes associated with increased addiction liability in rats.
"Are iron , zinc , and copper concentrations in breast milk independent of maternal mineral status?","Milk iron, zinc, and copper concentrations at 9 mo postpartum are not associated with maternal mineral status, which suggests active transport mechanisms in the mammary gland for all 3 minerals. Milk iron concentrations increase and milk zinc concentrations decrease during weaning [corrected]"
Is endoscopic ultrasound a sensitive and specific test to diagnose portal venous system thrombosis ( PVST )?,Linear EUS is a highly sensitive and specific test for PVST.
Is a novel gain-of-function mutation ( F821L ) in the transmembrane domain of calcium-sensing receptor a cause of severe sporadic hypoparathyroidism?,the F821Lmutation is therefore a novel gain-of-function mutation which can cause severe hypoparathyroidism. Thiazide diuretics lowered urinary calcium excretion of the patient treated with calcium supplementation and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D(3.)
Does rare KIT ( CD117 ) expression in multiple myeloma abrogate the usefulness of imatinib mesylate treatment?,"KIT expression is a rare event in MM and not detectable in MGUS and LPL. Therefore, treatment with imatinib is unlikely to be effective in these patients."
Does uncontrolled-rate freezing of peripheral blood progenitor cells allow successful engraftment by sparing primitive and committed hematopoietic progenitors?,"Our freezing procedure is fast and easy, and allows rapid hematopoietic recovery after myeloablative therapy by sparing primitive and committed hematopoietic progenitors. Our study strongly supports technical improvements aimed at cost reduction and feasibility of routine freezing procedures."
Is vitamin E bioavailability from fortified breakfast cereal greater than that from encapsulated supplements?,The low bioavailability of vitamin E from the 400-IU capsule and the variability observed when the capsule was consumed with cereal suggest that encapsulated vitamin E is poorly absorbed when consumed with a low-fat meal and that bioavailability can be enhanced by food fortification with vitamin E.
Does fibroblast growth factor-1 transcriptionally induce membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase expression in prostate carcinoma cell line?,"From these data, we conclude that FGF-1 induces MT1-MMP expression in prostate carcinoma cells through a transcriptional mechanism mediated through the FGFR and the transcription factor, STAT3. These results confirm earlier data indicating that acidic FGF and STAT3 are involved in the signaling leading to the expression of a MMP. Our findings support the idea that paracrine and autocrine factors play an important role in the regulation of MT1-MMP in human prostate carcinoma cells."
Is the des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin index a new prognostic indicator for hepatocellular carcinoma?,The prognosis of patients who had a high DCP Index score was poorer compared with patients who had a low DCP Index score and patients who were classified as DCP negative. The authors concluded that the DCP Index is a prognostic indicator for patients with HCC.
Does radiotherapy at a young age reduce uterine volume of childhood cancer survivors?,"Our results indicate that cytotoxic treatment in childhood does not affect adult uterine size. In contrast, uterine irradiation at a young age reduces adult uterine volume. The radiotherapy-induced damage is probably irreversible."
Does cisplatin augment cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated antitumor immunity in poorly immunogenic murine lung cancer?,"Cisplatin augments the antitumor effect of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated immunotherapy strategy, resulting in a higher cure rate than seen with immunotherapy alone. This effect is associated with the enhanced ability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to lyse tumor cells that have been exposed to cisplatin through Fas/Fas ligand interactions."
Is ultrafiltration volume associated with changes in blood pressure in chronically hemodialyzed patients?,"The ultrafiltration volume strongly affects postdialysis PP values. Evaluation of elevated blood pressure treatment in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis therapy must be considered in respect of postdialysis PP values, not just depending on pre/postdialysis systolic and diastolic pressur or MAP values."
Do peripheral leukocytes with HLA-DR+/CD8- phenotype are associated with prognosis in patients with lung cancer?,The subset of HLA-DR+/CD8- lymphocytes powerfully predicts the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
Does new used of vinyl tape for reliable collection and diagnosis of common superficial mycoses?,"In addition to improved patient compliance, ease of performance, and low cost, the technique seems appropriate for using in an office environment during a routine medical visit. Whenever vinyl tape specimens yield negative results, a scraping-sampled preparation should be provided."
Is the folate pool in colorectal cancers associated with DNA hypermethylation and with a polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase?,"The concentrations of FIs in colorectal tumors are directly related to the presence of frequent DNA hypermethylation and inversely related to the presence of a common polymorphism in the MTHFR gene. FIs could serve as biochemical markers for the risk of developing this disease, as well as for the prediction of toxicity and efficacy of fluorouracil-based treatments."
Does molecular and functional analysis identify ALK-1 as the predominant cause of pulmonary hypertension related to hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia?,The association of pulmonary arterial hypertension and HHT identifies an important disease complication and appears most common among subjects with defects in ALK-1 receptor signalling. Future studies should focus on detailed molecular analysis of the common cellular pathways disrupted by mutations of ALK-1 and BMPR2 that cause inherited pulmonary vascular disease.
Does regional low-flow perfusion provide comparable blood flow and oxygenation to both cerebral hemispheres during neonatal aortic arch reconstruction?,"Regional low-flow cerebral perfusion provides comparable blood flows and oxygenation to both cerebral hemispheres. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is recommended as a corroborative method with near-infrared spectroscopy to guide flow during regional low-flow cerebral perfusion, because cerebral blood volume index does not correlate with cerebral blood flow velocity."
Do alterations of beta-catenin and Tcf-4 instead of GSK-3beta contribute to activation of Wnt pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma?,Our present findings strongly suggest mutations of beta-catenin as well as over expression of beta-catenin and Tcf-4 gene activate the Wnt pathway in HCC independently with the target gene most likely to be C-myc.
Do [ The clinical staging and tissue bacterial quantification in the diagnosis of burn wound sepsis ]?,Burn wound sepsis could be established by identification of bacterial invasion into living tissue with clinical symptoms of toxemia.
Do systemic antibodies towards mucosal bacteria in ulcerative colitis and Crohn 's disease differentially activate the innate immune response?,"Changes in mucosal bacteria, and a switch from internal to surface antigen/antibody reactivity of a predominantly IgG1 type, leads to greater opsonisation of the respiratory burst in PMN, providing a mechanism for maintaining the inflammatory state in UC."
Does autobiographical memory predict the course of depression during detoxification therapy in alcohol dependent men?,No data are reported on depression prior to drinking onset.
Does epoetin requirement depend on dialysis dose when Kt/N > 1.33 in patients on regular dialysis treatment with cellulosic membranes and adequate iron stores?,"In iron-replete HD patients on cellulosic membranes and stabilized epoetin therapy, inadequate dialysis was associated with higher epoetin requirement, but for Kt/V values > or = 1.33, there was no further effect on epoetin responsiveness."
Is the association between state income inequality and worse health confounded by race?,"Our finding demonstrates that neither race, at the individual level, nor racial composition, as measured at the state level, explain away the previously reported association between income inequality and poorer health status in the US."
Does heart of glass regulate the concentric growth of the heart in zebrafish?,"heart of glass encodes a previously uncharacterized endocardial signal that is vital for patterning concentric growth of the heart. Growth of the heart requires addition of myocardial cells along the endocardial-to-myocardial axis. This axis of patterning is driven by heg, a novel transmembrane protein expressed in the endocardium."
Does sulforaphane inhibit growth of a colon cancer cell line?,These findings may help explain the epidemiologically proven protective effect of vegetables against colon cancer.
Does the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory measure more than anxiety?,"The TAI scale encompasses measures of anxiety, depression and well-being. Consequently, the overlap with other measures of depression may result from item selection. This work awaits replication in independent normal and pathological samples."
Does treatment result among tuberculosis patients treated by private lung specialists involved in a public-private mix project in Vietnam?,"This PPM project, which used a combination of training, supervision, standardised referral and information system and financial incentives, did not achieve sufficiently good treatment outcome by PPs. Possible reasons for the poor outcome include absence of subsidisation of drug costs and lack of regulatory enforcement."
Does european system for cardiac operative risk evaluation predict long-term survival in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting?,The predicted surgical risk in CABG patients as calculated by standard or logistic EuroSCORE is a strong predictor for long-term survival in addition to predicting operative survival for which it was originally designed.
Is contralateral high-grade carotid artery stenosis or occlusion associated with increased risk for poor neurologic outcome after elective carotid stent placement?,Contralateral high-grade ICA stenosis or occlusion was not associated with an increased risk for neurologic events after elective ICA stent placement.
Are pregnancy rates higher with intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection than with conventional intracytoplasmic injection?,Microinjection into retrieved oocytes of selected spermatozoa with strictly defined morphologically normal nuclei improves significantly the incidence of pregnancy in couples with previous ICSI failures.
Does cytokine correlate of clinical response patterns to infliximab treatment of ankylosing spondylitis?,"Although sequential cytokine analysis does not appear to be informative, baseline CRP and TNFalpha levels are useful markers of clinical response patterns in patients with AS treated with infliximab."
Is cortical cholinergic function more severely affected in parkinsonian dementia than in Alzheimer disease : an in vivo positron emission tomographic study?,Reduced cortical AChE activity is more characteristic of patients with PDem than of patients with mild AD.
Does single-dose dexmedetomidine reduce agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia in children?,"In children undergoing surgery using sevoflurane anesthesia, dexmedetomidine 0.3 micro g/kg administered in 10 min after induction reduced the incidence of emergence agitation from 37% in the control group to 10%. No adverse effects attributable to dexmedetomidine were observed."
Does orthostatic hypotension occur frequently in the first hour after anesthesia?,"Orthostatic hypotension, a failure to maintain blood pressure on assuming an upright posture, is common after general anesthesia for minor surgery and may be the major cause of postoperative orthostatic intolerance."
Is the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of UR-12746S on reactivated experimental colitis mediated through downregulation of cytokine production?,UR-12746S was able to prevent relapse in experimental colitis and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production participates in the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity exerted by this compound.
Do why primiparous mothers breastfeed in the United States : a national survey?,"Additional studies are needed to better understand why women ""prefer to bottle feed"", especially black women. Increasingly effective programs and policies to promote breastfeeding will logically follow. Since physical and medical problems are such common reasons both for never breastfeeding and for stopping breastfeeding, individual healthcare providers can have a significant impact on breastfeeding rates and duration."
Is bone loss in unclassified polyarthritis and early rheumatoid arthritis better detected by digital x ray radiogrammetry than dual x ray absorptiometry : relationship with disease activity and radiographic outcome?,"DXR is a useful measure of the destructive disease activity in patients with RA and unclassified polyarthritis, providing valuable information about bone changes associated with disease activity and erosive disease in early RA. DXR is better than DXA for detecting and monitoring periarticular osteoporosis of the metacarpal bone."
Are negative preoperative localization studies highly predictive of multiglandular disease in sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism?,"When preoperative localization study results are negative, the patient has a high risk of multiglandular disease, and a conventional cervicotomy with identification of the 4 glands is recommended strongly. When only 1 localization study is positive, the risk of multiglandular disease justifies the use of QPTH during a focused approach. When positive localization study results are concordant, the use of QPTH is questionable during a focused approach."
Is atrophy detectable within a 3-month period in untreated patients with active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis?,"The annualized atrophy rate found in this study is comparable with rates reported previously. Measurements of BPF allow detection of atrophy over short time intervals in active disease. The short-term relationship of inflammation to atrophy development was weak. Brain parenchymal fraction might be a promising measure in future phase 2 studies of agents, with an expected effect on tissue-destructive pathologic mechanisms of MS."
Is development of diabetes mellitus post-renal transplantation associated with poor short-term clinical outcomes?,PTDM is associated with poorer short-term outcomes than either non-DM or previous DM.
Does cadherin expression pattern in melanocytic tumors more likely depend on the melanocyte environment than on tumor cell progression?,"It is presumed that the gradual loss of E-cadherin expression represents a reaction of melanocytic cells to altered conditions in the dermal environment, e.g. lack of contact to keratinocytes, or new contact with dermal extracellular matrix molecules, respectively. Melanoma cells apparently are less dependent on these environmental factors and, therefore, show a more heterogeneous expression pattern. This might be of importance for the adaptation of the tumor cells to local requirements. However, in view of our results, a causative role of (loss of ) E-cadherin or (gain of ) N-cadherin for melanocytic tumor progression still remains to be proven."
Is image everything : pearls and pitfalls of digital photography and PowerPoint presentations for the cosmetic surgeon?,"In the past, high-quality clinical photography was complex and sometimes beyond the confines of a busy clinical practice. The digital revolution of the past decade has removed many of these associated barriers, and it has never been easier or more affordable to take images and use them in a multitude of ways for learning, judging surgical outcomes, teaching and lecturing, and marketing. Even though this technology has existed for years, many practitioners have failed to embrace it for various reasons or fears. By following a few simple techniques, even the most novice practitioner can be on the forefront of digital imaging technology. By observing a number of modified techniques with digital cameras, any practitioner can take high-quality, standardized clinical photographs and can make and use these images to enhance his or her practice. This article deals with common pitfalls of digital photography and PowerPoint presentations and presents multiple pearls to achieve proficiency quickly with digital photography and imaging as well as avoid malfunction of PowerPoint presentations in an academic lecture venue."
Is the TWEAK weak for alcohol screening among female Veterans Affairs outpatients?,The TWEAK has low sensitivity as an alcohol-screening questionnaire among female VA outpatients and should be evaluated further before being used in other female primary care populations. The three-item AUDIT-C was the optimal brief alcohol-screening questionnaire in this study.
Does impaired systemic ventricular relaxation affect postoperative short-term outcome in Fontan patients?,Tau was the only significant preoperative invasive predictor of short-term outcome in the Fontan patients. This illustrates the importance of systemic ventricular relaxation and highlights the need for a more comprehensive assessment of diastolic function before the Fontan operation.
Does treatment with anti-TGF-beta antibody ameliorate chronic progressive nephritis by inhibiting Smad/TGF-beta signaling?,"In chronic progressive ATS nephritis, the TGF-beta/Smad signaling was up-regulated. TGF-beta blockade by alphaT suppressed the progression of renal scarring, at least in part, via inhibition of activated TGF-beta/Smad signaling."
Is a new mutation ( intron 9 +1 G > T ) in the SLC12A3 gene linked to Gitelman syndrome in Gypsies?,"Demonstration of a novel point mutation within the SLC12A3 gene in our cohort of Gypsy families with Gitelman syndrome is highly suggestive of a founder effect. This finding will facilitate the identification of the genetic defect in further cases of Gitelman syndrome among the Gypsy population. Our study represents the largest series ever published of patients with Gitelman syndrome having the same underlying mutation, and supports the lack of correlation between genotype and clinical phenotype in this disease."
Are multiple high risk HPV infections common in cervical neoplasia and young women in a cervical screening population?,"Multiple HR-HPV infections were most prevalent in young women. Multiple HR-HPV infections were not more frequent in high grade than in low grade cervical neoplasia, reflecting common sexual transmission of multiple HR-HPV. Prospective cohort studies linking sequential loss or gain of HPV types with cytological analysis are required to assess the impact of multiple HR-HPV infections on neoplastic progression."
Is iodine -131 metaiodobenzylguanidine an effective treatment for malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma?,"These data support (131)I-MIBG treatment for select patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma. In our experience, prolonged survival was best predicted by symptomatic and hormone response to (131)I-MIBG treatment. An initial dose of 500 mCi may be optimal. The benefit of (131)I-MIBG treatment for metastatic pheochromocytoma must also be weighed against its side effects."
Do social support and oxytocin interact to suppress cortisol and subjective responses to psychosocial stress?,Oxytocin seems to enhance the buffering effect of social support on stress responsiveness. These results concur with data from animal research suggesting an important role of oxytocin as an underlying biological mechanism for stress-protective effects of positive social interactions.
Is one-year posttransplant renal function a strong predictor of long-term kidney function : results from the Neoral-MOST Observational Study?,"Serum creatinine at 1 year is influenced by risk factors known to affect overall graft survival and is predictive of 5-year renal graft function. The effects of delayed graft function and acute rejection appear to be limited to their influence on serum creatinine at 1 year, whereas donor type and previous graft predominantly affect later stages of graft life."
Do red wine polyphenolic compounds inhibit atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice independently of effects on lipid peroxidation?,These results suggest that lipid deposition is independent of lipid oxidation and that the protective action of red wine polyphenols is independent of any antioxidant action of these compounds.
Does intervention with tranilast attenuate renal pathology and albuminuria in advanced experimental diabetic nephropathy?,"Tranilast, when administered during the course of experimental diabetic nephropathy, attenuates tubulointerstitial pathology and albuminuria. These findings are consistent with the antagonist effects of tranilast on TGF-beta actions in the diabetic kidney."
Does intra-amygdala infusion of the NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP 3226 attenuate operant ethanol self-administration?,Results from this study indicate that alcohol-reinforced responding is reduced by acute blockade of NPY Y1 receptors in the amygdala of rats with a long-term history of alcohol self-administration. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that alcohol self-administration is maintained by NPY neurotransmission at Y1 receptors in the central nucleus of the amygdala.
Is the dermoscopic classification of atypical melanocytic naevi ( Clark naevi ) useful to discriminate benign from malignant melanocytic lesions?,The dermoscopic classification of atypical naevi (Clark naevi) is useful to discriminate benign from malignant melanocytic lesions. The three-structure type and eccentric peripheral hyperpigmentation were significantly more frequently found in malignant than in benign melanocytic lesions. The knowledge of these two dermoscopic types should be helpful for the management of patients presenting with multiple melanocytic lesions.
"Is sonographic assessment of the cervix before , during and after a uterine contraction effective in predicting the course of labor?",Real-time ultrasound observation of the cervix during uterine contraction could help differentiate inefficient uterine contractions from normal ones and thus predict the subsequent course of labor.
Does methylphenidate improve response inhibition in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder?,"Adult ADHD patients had a response inhibition profile similar to that produced by lesions to the right inferior frontal cortex, which was remedied by stimulant medication."
Is coexistence of HER2 over-expression and p53 protein accumulation a strong prognostic molecular marker in breast cancer?,The findings of the present study indicate that the coexistence of HER2 over-expression and p53 protein accumulation is a strong prognostic molecular marker in breast cancer.
Does exposure to pulsed magnetic fields enhance motor recovery in cats after spinal cord injury?,This preliminary study indicates that pulsed magnetic fields may have beneficial effects on motor function recovery and lesion volume size after acute spinal cord injury.
Does central adiposity determine prevalence differences of the metabolic syndrome?,"Contrary to men, the metabolic syndrome is more prevalent in Spanish women than in women from San Antonio with differences that mirror differences in central adiposity. Central adiposity and blood pressure may be used to exclude the metabolic syndrome. Considering recent secular trends in obesity, we predict there will be an increase in the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in both populations in the coming years."
Do influence of demographics and inhalation injury on burn mortality in children?,"Inhalation injury remains one of the primary contributors to burn mortality. Children under the age of 3 years, however, are at a higher risk both with and without inhalation injury."
Are bilateral anterior thalamic nucleus lesions and high-frequency stimulation protective against pilocarpine-induced seizures and status epilepticus?,Bilateral anterior thalamic nuclear complex stimulation and thalamotomies were protective against SE induced by pilocarpine.
"Is dietary linolenic acid inversely associated with plasma triacylglycerol : the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute Family Heart Study?",Consumption of total linolenic acid is inversely related to plasma triacylglycerol concentrations in both white men and white women. This suggests a pathway by which dietary linolenic acid might reduce cardiovascular disease risk.
Do intestinal parasites increase the dietary lysine requirement in chronically undernourished Indian men?,"On the basis of the 24-h indicator amino acid balance approach, it appears that intestinal infestation with parasites increases the requirement for lysine and that this may be one factor responsible for the higher lysine requirement observed in persons with chronic undernutrition."
Is gastroschisis caused by the combination of carbon monoxide and protein-zinc deficiencies in mice?,"The data indicates that gastroschisis is caused by the combination of protein-zinc deficiencies and carbon monoxide exposure during gestation. The finding may be relevant to human populations that experience protein and zinc deficiencies during gestation, and are exposed to CO pollution, or cigarette, or marijuana smoke during pregnancy."
Does pretreatment with periodate-oxidized adenosine enhance developmental toxicity of inorganic arsenic in mice?,"These results demonstrate that the developmental toxicity of inorganic arsenic can be enhanced by PAD, due possibly to inhibited methylation of arsenic."
Does cognitive impairment decrease postural control during dual tasks in geriatric patients with a history of severe falls?,Even simple additional tasks substantially decrease postural stability due to attention-related cognitive deficits in cognitively impaired geriatric patients with a history of severe falls. The findings may help to explain the increased incidence and severity of falls in geriatric patients with cognitive impairment and a history of falls resulting in injury.
Does differing risk factors for fall in nursing home and intermediate-care residents who can and can not stand unaided?,The findings indicate that there are different risk factors for falls for people living in residential aged care facilities who can and cannot stand unaided. These findings provide important information for developing fall-prevention strategies and suggest that those who can stand unaided but have multiple falls risk factors constitute the highest priority group for such interventions.
Is peak stimulated insulin secretion associated with specific changes in gene expression profiles in sporadic insulinomas?,"We show that genes that are relevant to the pathogenesis of hyperinsulinemia are expressed preferentially in insulinomas. In addition, patients with a distinct and common pattern of gene expression had significantly higher stimulated insulin secretion levels. The study of these genes may help to identify the biochemical pathways that are responsible for pathologic insulin secretion."
Is decrease in PaCO2 with prone position predictive of improved outcome in acute respiratory distress syndrome?,ALI/ARDS patients who respond to prone positioning with reduction of their Paco2 show an increased survival at 28 days. Improved efficiency of alveolar ventilation (decreased physiologic deadspace ratio) is an important marker of patients who will survive acute respiratory failure.
Is thyroid function associated with presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis?,These data in patients referred for coronary angiography suggest that variation of thyroid function within the statistical normal range may influence the presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis.
Does acupuncture decrease somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes to noxious stimuli in anesthetized volunteers?,"This double-blinded study demonstrates that electric needle acupuncture, as compared with sham treatment, significantly decreases the magnitudes of late somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes with electrical noxious stimulation in anesthetized subjects, suggesting a specific analgesic effect of acupuncture."
Does fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography improve preoperative staging of resectable lung metastasis?,PET scan proved to be a valuable staging procedure in patients with clinically resectable lung metastasis and changed the therapeutic management in a high proportion of cases.
Does reduced p16 expression correlate with lymphatic invasion in colorectal cancers?,"In colorectal cancers, a significant correlation of reduced p16 expression and lymphatic invasion was observed, which suggested and colorectal cancers with reduced p16 expression have more aggressive potential of lymphatic infiltration. Also a significant correlation between the overexpression of p16 and tumor progression was demonstrated."
Is recent unstable angina and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting related to postoperative atrial fibrillation?,Post-CABG AF is associated with more complicated postoperative outcome. Recent unstable angina and off-pump procedure is not related to the occurrence of post-CABG AF.
"Is aPOE associated with age-of-onset , but not cognitive functioning , in late-life depression?","The finding that neither LLD, accompanying cognitive impairment, nor late age-of-onset was associated with an increased APOE4 allele frequency suggests that LLD acts as a risk factor for developing AD as well as non-AD dementia through mechanisms independent of APOE4. The unexpected finding that age-of-onset of LLD was significantly reduced in APOE4 carriers is similar to the association between APOE4 and age-of-onset in AD. Replication of the association of APOE4 with earlier age-of-depression-onset is indicated."
Does loss of caspase-8 protein expression correlate with unfavorable survival outcome in childhood medulloblastoma?,"Loss of initiator caspase-8 is associated with an unfavorable survival outcome. Restoration of caspase-8 (e.g., by treatment with IFN-gamma) might, therefore, represent a novel experimental therapy in childhood MB."
Is progression of cervical carcinomas associated with down-regulation of CD9 but strong local re-expression at sites of transendothelial invasion?,"We found that CD9, strongly expressed by cells forming the basal layer of normal squamous epithelium of the cervix, is down-regulated in most invasive cervical carcinomas (correlation with stage, P = 0.015) but apparently re-expressed at distinct regions during tumor progression. Tumor sites with pronounced localized expression of CD9 (CD9 hotspots) include cones growing into blood or lymphatic vessels, pointing to a functional role of CD9 in transendothelial migration as a crucial step in the formation of lymph node metastases. Remarkably, CD9 hotspots were found to be a highly significant (P < 10(-5)) indicator of lymphangiosis: they were observed in 15 of 18 cases with histopathologically confirmed lymphangiosis compared with 4 of 26 other cervical carcinomas. We postulate, therefore, that clusters of tumor cells characterized by strong expression of CD9 may be useful as an indicator of high risk of recurrence in early-stage cervical cancer, providing a basis for clinical decisions in favor of additional treatment."
Does cognitive-behavioral stress management improve stress-management skills and quality of life in men recovering from treatment of prostate carcinoma?,"A 10-week cognitive-behavioral group intervention was effective in improving the QoL in men treated for PC, and these changes were associated significantly with intervention-associated increases in perceived stress-management skills."
Is abundant expression of HIV Nef and Rev proteins in brain astrocytes in vivo associated with dementia?,"In adult human brain, astrocytes are infected by HIV and preferentially express HIV Nef and Rev proteins but are also sometimes productively infected. Astrocyte infection is associated with moderate to severe dementia which agrees with recent knowledge on the housekeeping activities of astrocytes and their eventual role in learning and memory."
Does a circumferential stress-growth rule predict arcade arteriole formation in a network model?,The simulations presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that arteriolar remodeling is stimulated by increased levels of circumferential wall stress and that new arcade arteriole formation is a consequence of terminal arteriolar growth.
Is the repeated measurement of vital capacity a poor predictor of the need for mechanical ventilation in myasthenia gravis?,"VC repeated measurements is a poor predictor of the need for further MV in MG patients. This can probably be ascribed to the erratic nature of MG, a disease whose course is largely influenced by many parameters (infection, treatment modifications, initiation of corticosteroid therapy, stress, psychological factors, etc.). Early admissions to the ICU of MG patients with respiratory dysfunction is thus recommended."
Does intranasal administration of the GHRP hexarelin accelerate growth in short children?,"The long-term GH/IGF-I stimulating, anabolic and growth promoting effects achieved by intranasal administration of this hexapeptide, seemingly without undesirable side-effects, suggests clinical potential for this new class of drugs."
Does analysis of families at risk for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus reveal that HLA antigens influence progression to clinical disease?,"HLA-DR3 and DQ2 predispose to islet autoimmunity, but not development of clinical IDDM in the absence and DR4 and DQ8. DR4 and DQ8 predispose to the development of clinical IDDM in ICA-positive relatives, in combination with DR3-DQ2 and other haplotypes but not when homozygous. HLA-A24 is significantly associated with rapid progression to IDDM in ICA-positive relatives and with an earlier age at clinical diagnosis. Analysis of IDDM families reveals that HLA genes not only predispose to islet autoimmunity but influence progression to clinical disease. The findings have implications for identifying high-risk relatives as candidates for possible preventative therapy."
Does transgenic expression of human acetylcholinesterase induce progressive cognitive deterioration in mice?,"We conclude that upsetting cholinergic balance may by itself cause progressive memory decline in mammals, suggesting that congenital and/or acquired changes in this vulnerable balance may contribute to the physiopathology of Alzheimer's disease."
Do anatomic site evaluation of edentulous maxillae for dental implant placement?,"Maxillary tuberosity is the least desirable site for the placement of implants in the maxilla. The area corresponding to the first and second molars had the least bone thickness. All measures of bone preservation need to be considered, especially in this area."
Do autoantibodies to neuronal glutamate receptors in patients with paraneoplastic neurodegenerative syndrome enhance receptor activation?,The occurrence of autoantibodies to specific neuronal neurotransmitter subunits in the sera of patients with PNS and the ability of these autoantibodies to modulate glutaminergic receptor function suggest that some paraneoplastic neurological injury could result from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity.
Is tyrosine phosphorylation in psoriatic T cells modulated by drugs that induce or improve psoriasis?,We have characterized important differences in p-tyr phosphorylation activities of psoriatic T cells compared to controls. This could be a hint to explain the known abnormalities of psoriatic T cells.
Do odorant receptors and desensitization proteins colocalize in mammalian sperm?,"The specific localization of odorant receptors to the respiratory center of mature sperm is consistent with a role for these proteins in transducing chemotactic signals. Based on the colocalization, it is plausible that GRK3 and beta-arrestin2 function in sperm to regulate putative chemoreceptor responses."
Does nerve growth factor prevent both neuroretinal programmed cell death and capillary pathology in experimental diabetes?,"These data provide new insight into the mechanism of diabetic retinal vascular damage, and suggest that NGF or other neurotrophic factors may have potential as therapeutic agents for the prevention of human diabetic retinopathy."
Does regression to the mean occur in measuring peak urinary flow?,Regression to the mean occurs when patients are selected on the basis of a low Qmax. The use of isolated low values of Qmax in the process of diagnosing BPH should be avoided.
Does lung tumor growth correlate with glucose metabolism measured by fluoride-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography?,These data suggest a direct relation between tumor growth and FDG uptake in lung cancer. The technique of FDG PET demonstrates exceptional accuracy and may permit prompt diagnosis of lung cancer.
Do hypervariable microsatellites provide a general source of polymorphic DNA markers for the chloroplast genome?,PCR-based analysis of mononucleotide repeats may be used to detect both intraspecific and interspecific variability in the chloroplast genomes of seed plants. The analysis of polymorphic microsatellites thus provides an important experimental tool to examine a range of issues in plant genetics.
Does preimplantation factor ( PIF ) predict subsequent pregnancy loss?,Measurement of PIF throughout the first trimester of pregnancy predicts subsequent pregnancy loss.
Do cues parents use to assess postoperative pain in their children?,"Parents frequently cited using verbal report and appetite as cues to how their children were feeling. A variety of other cue types were also reported by parents, including activity level, sleep quality, visible/audible discomfort, and physiological observations. Cue types were not significantly related to the child's gender, and only one cue type was significantly related to the child's age (appetite was used more often for older children than younger children). The presence or absence of illness behavior cues (e.g., protective behavior, visible/audible discomfort) as well as disruptions to normal behavior pattern cues (e.g., sleep, level of activity) was related, in the expected direction, to the pain intensity ratings. This study provides insights into the cues parents use to assess pain in their children and serves as a foundation for future studies on parents' assessment of children's pain."
Does pulse dexamethasone impair growth and body composition of very low birth weight infants?,"PDEX negatively affected glucose metabolism and growth patterns during and immediately after drug exposure. However, assessment near term gestational age showed similar body composition and size in both groups."
Is carbonic anhydrase IX ( CAIX ) an independent predictor of outcome in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) after long-term follow-up?,"After additional long-term follow-up of our large cohort, our results continue to suggest that CAIX is not an independent prognostic marker for ccRCC."
Is a +20 % adjustment in the computed tomography measured ureteral length an accurate predictor of true ureteral length before ureteral stent placement?,CT-measured ureteral length adjusted up by 20% is a reliable method to accurately measure the true ureteral length. This method is superior to traditional indirect methods that rely on body habitus measurements.
Does pathohistological subtype predict survival in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) of the pancreas?,"Evaluation of IPMN subtypes supports postoperative patient prognosis prediction. Therefore, subtype differentiation could lead to improvements in clinical management. Potentially identifying subgroups with the need for adjuvant therapy may be possible."

The consistent clinical course of fetuses with prenatal demise suggests careful targeted monitoring during late gestation."
Does preferring thin people imply derogating fat people . A Rasch analysis of the implicit weight attitude?,"A significant implicit preference for thin relative to fat people was observed in all weight groups. In normal weight and obese individuals, the preference was mostly affected by positive stimuli (more easily associated with thin than with fat people). In underweight individuals, the preference was mostly guided by positive (more easily associated with thin than with fat people) and negative (more easily associated with fat than with thin people) stimuli. In overweight individuals, all stimuli contributed to the preference in a similar way. In all weight groups, the implicit weight attitude correlated with the explicit preference and/or the thin thermometer, whereas it never correlated with the fat thermometer. A pro-thin bias was observed in normal weight and obese individuals, whereas both a pro-thin and an anti-fat bias were observed in underweight individuals. A clear preference for thin people relative to fat people was observed in overweight individuals. Therefore, uncritically interpreting the implicit preference for thin people as a sign of derogating fat people might be misleading."
