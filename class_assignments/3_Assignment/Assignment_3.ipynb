We use the [T5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf) model, presented by Raffel et al.  T5 is an encoder-decoder architecture pre-trained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks. In this task, we set up a fine-tuning example for question answering using the [SQUAD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad) dataset. Since the actual fine-tuning is time-consuming and computational intensive for inference, we use an already pre-trained model. The main goal is to introduce you to the structure of the fine-tuning and its simplicity with the Hugging Face framework."

For example, we prepend the input sequence with `translate English to German: ` before encoding the input to tell the model to translate.
