Another study found that higher education was associated with a lower risk of developing AD.

The abstract provides evidence of an online curriculum in social intelligence (SI) that was administered with facilitation in Spanish by classroom instructors to 207 students from Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid. The program was found to significantly increase most measures of social intelligence for program participants in comparison to controls with no effects of gender or age on program effectiveness.

            "response:  The Flynn effect challenges the understanding of IQ tests over time because it suggests that IQ scores are increasing over time, resulting in norms becoming obsolete. While the Flynn effect is widely accepted, efforts to estimate its magnitude and error of measurement have been controversial and have prevented determination of factors that moderate the Flynn effect across different IQ tests. A metaanalysis was conducted to determine the magnitude of the Flynn effect with a higher degree of precision to determine the error of measurement and to assess the impact of several moderator variables on the mean effect size. The metaanalytic mean was 231.95 standard score points per decade, and the mean effect size for 53 comparisons was 293.95 IQ points per decade. However, these results did not support the hypothesis that the Flynn effect is diminishing. The Flynn effect varies significantly by age and ability level, and reverse Flynn effects have been identified in some countries. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific context and population when interpreting IQ test results.\n",

For example, a study found that higher premorbid intelligence was associated with a lower risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Another study found that higher education was associated with a lower risk of developing AD. However, it is important to note that these associations may be influenced by other factors, such as comorbid medical conditions and brain pathology. Therefore, further research is needed to better understand the relationship between intelligence and AD risk.\n",

            "response:  The Flynn effect challenges the understanding of IQ tests over time because it suggests that IQ scores are increasing over time, resulting in norms becoming obsolete. While the Flynn effect is widely accepted, efforts to estimate its magnitude and error of measurement have been controversial and have prevented determination of factors that moderate the Flynn effect across different IQ tests. A metaanalysis was conducted to determine the magnitude of the Flynn effect with a higher degree of precision to determine the error of measurement and to assess the impact of several moderator variables on the mean effect size. The metaanalytic mean was 231.95 standard score points per decade, and the mean effect size for 53 comparisons was 293.95 IQ points per decade. However, these results did not support the hypothesis that the Flynn effect is diminishing. The Flynn effect varies significantly by age and ability level, and reverse Flynn effects have been identified in some countries. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific context and population when interpreting IQ test results.\n",

The abstract provides evidence of an online curriculum in social intelligence (SI) that was administered with facilitation in Spanish by classroom instructors to 207 students from Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid. The program was found to significantly increase most measures of social intelligence for program participants in comparison to controls with no effects of gender or age on program effectiveness.

            "response:  The Flynn effect challenges the understanding of IQ tests over time because it suggests that IQ scores are increasing over time, resulting in norms becoming obsolete. While the Flynn effect is widely accepted, efforts to estimate its magnitude and error of measurement have been controversial and have prevented determination of factors that moderate the Flynn effect across different IQ tests. A metaanalysis was conducted to determine the magnitude of the Flynn effect with a higher degree of precision to determine the error of measurement and to assess the impact of several moderator variables on the mean effect size. The metaanalytic mean was 231.95 standard score points per decade, and the mean effect size for 53 comparisons was 293.95 IQ points per decade. However, these results did not support the hypothesis that the Flynn effect is diminishing. The Flynn effect varies significantly by age and ability level, and reverse Flynn effects have been identified in some countries. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific context and population when interpreting IQ test results.\n",

        "This document provides an analysis of how a medical chatbot handles a variety of \"edge case\" questions. These questions fall into different categories, such as unrelated queries, queries in other languages, one-word queries, very long queries, poorly structured queries, and medical-related queries. The chatbot's responses are evaluated based on three different similarity score thresholds (0.75, 0.80, 0.85) to determine how these thresholds affect the chatbot's ability to provide relevant answers or admit lack of knowledge by responding with \"I don't know\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Summary Table:** Shows the count of questions in each category for them at least one document retrieved by the retriever so that were answered without resorting to \"Sorry, but I don't know as my capabilities are focused on medical assistance\", across different similarity score thresholds. This helps in understanding which similarity threshold provides the best balance between providing answers and acknowledging when it cannot provide a relevant response.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Detailed Responses:** Lists each question along with the chatbot's response and the number of source documents retrieved (if any), for each similarity score threshold. This detailed breakdown allows for a closer examination of how the chatbot's performance varies not just between different categories of questions, but also how it adjusts its responses based on the similarity score.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this analysis is to fine-tune the chatbot's parameters for optimal performance, ensuring it can handle a wide range of queries effectively, while also recognizing its limitations in certain scenarios.\n",
