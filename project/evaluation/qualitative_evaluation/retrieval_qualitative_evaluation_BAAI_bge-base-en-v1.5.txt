Query: Is occupational outcome in bipolar disorder predicted by premorbid functioning and intelligence?

  Chunk: Abstract: Bipolar disorder BD over the long term can manifest a variety of outcomes depending on a number of different conditions There is a need for further knowledge regarding preventive factors as well as predictors of the disabling course of the disorder Studies regarding the impact on functional outcome of premorbid and current general intellectual function intelligence quotient IQ and premorbid functioning in BD patients are sparse The present study addressed the role of premorbid functioning assessed with the Premorbid Adjustment Scale PAS intelligence course of illness and sociodemographics on occupational outcome in BD Bipolar disorder patients were recruited consecutively from psychiatric units outpatient and inpatient in four major hospitals in Oslo Norway N 226 644 bipolar I disorder BDI 301 bipolar II disorder BDII 55 bipolar disorder not otherwise specified BDNOS 386 males The associations between current IQ premorbid IQ assessed using the National Adult Reading Test NART PAS clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and receipt of disability benefit were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses The number of hospitalizations for depressive episodes and illness duration was associated with a higher risk of receipt of disability benefit PAS premorbid and current IQ as well as decline in IQ did not explain the higher risk of receipt of disability benefits Severe clinical course of BD was associated with receipt of disability benefit Occupational outcome was unrelated to PAS premorbid and current IQ as well as decline in IQ This suggests that the persistence of severe clinical symptoms rather than global cognitive functioning determines occupational outcome in BD and emphasizes the protective potential of early and continuous clinical treatment

  Chunk: Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric syndrome defined by periodic mood shifts Patients with bipolar disorder show cognitive impairments relative to healthy controls The risk of developing schizophrenia and partially also bipolar disorder has previously been shown to increase with lower premorbid intelligence It is not known if premorbid intelligence is associated with level of functioning and illness severity of people having developed bipolar disorder We used multiple linear and ordinal regression to analyze how premorbid intelligence as measured at conscription associate with functional outcome and illness severity in Swedish male bipolar disorder patients n 788 We found that lower premorbid intelligence is associated with lower percentage of time in work after adjusting for age and bipolar subtype and correcting for multiple comparisons We also found a strong negative association with the total number of inpatient episodes and psychiatric comorbidity but not with interepisodic remission treatment with psychotherapy or lithium or the presence of any complicating socioeconomical factors Adjusting for confounding genetic factors using polygenic risk scores for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia had no effect on the associations This study lacks females and controls and may thus have lower generalizability In conclusion premorbid intelligence is associated with both level of functioning and illness severity as well as comorbidity in bipolar disorder patients Further research is needed to develop targeted interventions for this subgroup of bipolar disorder patients

Query: Is cognitive ability in early adulthood associated with later suicide and suicide attempt : the role of risk factors over the life course?

  Chunk: Abstract: Longitudinal studies show that lower cognitive performance in adolescence and early adulthood is associated with higher risk of suicide death throughout adulthood However it is unclear whether this cognitive vulnerability originates earlier in childhood since studies conducted in children are scarce and have inconsistent results Vital status of 49853 individuals born between 1959 and 1966 to participants in the Collaborative Perinatal Project cohort was determined by a probabilistic linkage to the National Death Index covering all US deaths occurring from 1979 through 2016 Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine associations of general verbal and nonverbal intelligence at ages 4 and 7 and academic skills at age 7 with suicide death coded according to ICD910 criteria while accounting for sociodemographic and pregnancy factors previously associated with suicide in this sample By the end of 2016 288 cohort members had died by suicide Cognitive performance at 7 years on tests with verbal components was associated with suicide risk average vs high verbal intelligence HR 197 95 CI 105371 low vs high spelling skills HR 202 95 CI 116351 low vs high reading skills HR 201 95 CI 127317 Associations were still evident especially for verbal intelligence and reading skills but hazard ratios were attenuated after adjusting for prenatal and sociodemographic factors at birth verbal intelligence HR 197 95 CI 103378 spelling HR 161 95 CI 090288 reading HR 167 95 CI 102272 Childhood neurocognitive performance is associated with vulnerability to suicide mortality through middleadulthood suggesting that there might be a cognitive diathesis for suicide originating in early childhood Future studies should examine how multiple domains of childhood cognitive performance contribute to vulnerability to suicide risk including by increasing risk for social and environmental factors that are associated not only with suicide but also with many types of psychiatric disorders

Query: Does parenting behavior at 2 years predict school-age performance at 7 years in very preterm children?

  Chunk: Abstract: To examine factors which predict parenting stress in a longitudinal cohort of children born very preterm and seen at age 7 years We recruited 100 very preterm 32 weeks gestational age childparent dyads and a control group of 50 termborn dyads born between 2001 and 2004 with followup at 7 years Parents completed the Parenting Stress Index Ways of Coping Questionnaire Child Behavior Check List Beck Depression Inventory and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires Child IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence ScaleIV After controlling for maternal education parents of preterm children 95 CI 1111 to 1214 scored higher p0027 on the Parenting Stress Index than termborn controls 95 CI 978 to 1132 Regression analyses showed that child externalising behaviour sex and parent escapeavoidance coping style predicted higher parenting stress in the preterm group Parents of preterm girls expressed higher levels of stress than those of boys Maladaptive coping strategies contribute to greater stress in parents of very preterm children Our findings suggest that these parents need support for many years after birth of a very preterm infant

Query: Is excess of runs of homozygosity associated with severe cognitive impairment in intellectual disability?

  Chunk: Abstract: The harmful effects of inbreeding are well known by geneticists and several studies have already reported cases of intellectual disability caused by recessive variants in consanguineous families Nevertheless the effects of inbreeding on the degree of intellectual disability are still poorly investigated Here we present a detailed analysis of the homozygosity regions in a cohort of 612 patients with intellectual disabilities of different degrees We investigated i the runs of homozygosity distribution between syndromic and nonsyndromic ID ii the effect of runs of homozygosity on the ID degree using the intelligence quotient score Our data revealed no significant differences in the first analysis instead we detected significantly larger runs of homozygosity stretches in severe ID compared to nonsevere ID cases P 0007 together with an increase of the percentage of genome covered by runs of homozygosity P 003 In accord with the recent findings regarding autism and other neurological disorders this study reveals the important role of autosomal recessive variants in intellectual disability The amount of homozygosity seems to modulate the degree of cognitive impairment despite the intellectual disability cause

  Chunk: Abstract: Recent studies of the genetic foundations of cognitive ability rely on large samples in extreme hundreds of thousands of individuals from relatively outbred populations of mostly European ancestry Hypothesizing that the genetic foundation of cognitive ability depends on the broader populationspecific genetic context we performed a genomewide association study and homozygosity mapping of cognitive ability estimates obtained through latent variable modeling in a sample of 354 children from a consanguineous population of Saudi Arabia Approximately half of the sample demonstrated significantly elevated homozygosity levels indicative of inbreeding and among those with elevated levels homozygosity was negatively associated with cognitive ability Further homozygosity mapping identified a specific run inclusive of the iGRIA4i gene that survived corrections for multiple testing for association with cognitive ability The results suggest that in a consanguineous population a notable proportion of the variance in cognitive ability in the normal range in children might be regulated by populationspecific mechanisms such as patterns of elevated homozygosity This observation has implications for the fields understanding of the etiological bases of intelligence and its variability around the world

  Chunk: Abstract: The chromosome bands 15q24115q243 contain a complex region with numerous segmental duplications that predispose to regional microduplications and microdeletions both of which have been linked to intellectual disability speech delay and autistic features The region may also harbour common inversion polymorphisms whose functional and phenotypic manifestations are unknown Using single nucleotide polymorphism SNP data we detected four large contiguous haplotypegenotypes at 15q24 with Mendelian inheritance in 2562 trios African origin high population stratification and reduced recombination rates Although the haplotypegenotypes have been most likely generated by decreased or absent recombination among them we could not confirm that they were the product of inversion polymorphisms in the region One of the blocks was composed of three haplotypegenotypes N1a N1b and N2 which significantly correlated with intelligence quotient IQ in 2735 children of European ancestry from three independent population cohorts Homozygosity for N2 was associated with lower verbal IQ 24point loss pvalue 001 while homozygosity for N1b was associated with 32point loss in nonverbal IQ pvalue 00006 The three alleles strongly correlated with expression levels of MAN2C1 and SNUPN in blood and brain Homozygosity for N2 correlated with overexpression of MAN2C1 over many brain areas but the occipital cortex where N1b homozygous highly underexpressed Our populationbased analyses suggest that MAN2C1 may contribute to the verbal difficulties observed in microduplications and to the intellectual disability of microdeletion syndromes whose characteristic dosage increment and removal may affect different brain areas

  Chunk: Abstract: Studies from the UK have shown that children with Down syndrome acquire more academic skills in regular education Does this likewise hold true for the Dutch situation even after the effect of selective placement has been taken into account In 2006 an extensive questionnaire was sent to 160 parents of specially and regularly placed children with Down syndrome born 19932000 in primary education in the Netherlands with a response rate of 76 Questions were related to the childs school history academic and nonacademic skills intelligence quotient parental educational level the extent to which parents worked on academics with their child at home and the amount of academic instructional time at school Academic skills were predicted with the other variables as independents For the children in regular schools much more time proved to be spent on academics Academic performance appeared to be predicted reasonably well on the basis of age nonacademic skills parental educational level and the extent to which parents worked at home on academics However more variance could be predicted when the total amount of years that the child spent in regular education was added especially regarding reading and to a lesser extent regarding writing and math In addition we could prove that this finding could not be accounted for by endogenity Regularly placed children with Down syndrome learn more academics However this is not a straight consequence of inclusive placement and age alone but is also determined by factors such as cognitive functioning nonacademic skills parental educational level and the extent to which parents worked at home on academics Nevertheless it could be proven that the more advanced academic skills of the regularly placed children are not only due to selective placement The positive effect of regular school on academics appeared to be most pronounced for reading skills

  Chunk: Abstract: In education research and education policy much attention is paid to schools curricula and teachers but little attention is paid to the characteristics of students Differences in general cognitive ability igi are often overlooked as a source of important variance among schools and in outcomes among students within schools Standardized test scores such as the SAT and ACT are reasonably good proxies for igi and are available for most incoming college students Though the idea of igi being important in education is quite old we present contemporary evidence that colleges and universities in the United States vary considerably in the average cognitive ability of their students which correlates strongly with other methods including international methods of ranking colleges We also show that these igi differences are reflected in the extent to which graduates of colleges are represented in various highstatus and highincome occupations Finally we show how including individuallevel measures of cognitive ability can substantially increase the statistical power of experiments designed to measure educational treatment effects We conclude that education policy researchers should give more consideration to the concept of individual differences in cognitive ability as well as other factors

  Chunk: the practical exams The same trend was observed for the total sample and when subdivided by sex In the total sample significant differences in theoretical and practical exam grades were noted between chronotypes MT ivsi ET ipi 002 ipi 0006 and MT ivsi NT ipi 04 ipi 003 The differences between the males were significant for the theoretical ipi 006 MT ivsi NT ipi 002 and the practical subjects MT ivsi ET ipi 004 MT ivsi NT ipi 01 but no significant differences were noted between the females Our findings indicate overall better academic achievement by the MT students whereas the NT had lower exam grades for the theoretical subjects and the ET performed worse on the practical exams We speculate that the higher intelligence expressed by the ET students might have helped them compensate the disadvantage on the theoretical but not on practical exams in which the effect of misalignment between circadian preferences and university class schedule was more evident...

Query: Are extremely low gestational age and very low birthweight for gestational age risk factors for autism spectrum disorder in a large cohort study of 10-year-old children born at 23-27 weeks ' gestation?

  Chunk: Abstract: No prospective cohort study of highrisk children has used rigorous exposure assessment and optimal diagnostic procedures to examine the perinatal antecedents of autism spectrum disorder separately among those with and without cognitive impairment We sought to identify perinatal factors associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder with and without intellectual disability intelligence quotient 70 in children born extremely preterm This prospective multicenter 14 institutions in 5 states birth cohort study included children born at 2327 weeks gestation in 2002 through 2004 who were evaluated for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability at age 10 years Pregnancy information was obtained from medical records and by structured maternal interview Cervicalvaginal infection refers to maternal report of bacterial infection n 4 bacterial vaginosis n 30 yeast infection n 62 mixed infection n 4 or otherunspecified infection n 43 eg chlamydia trichomonas or herpes We do not know the extent to which infection per se was confirmed by microbial colonization We use the terms fetal growth restriction and small for gestational age interchangeably in light of the ongoing challenge to discern pathologically from constitutionally small newborns Severe fetal growth restriction was defined as a birthweight Zscore for gestational age at delivery 2 ie 2 SD below the median birthweight in a referent sample that excluded pregnancies delivered for preeclampsia or fetal indications Participants were classified into 4 groups based on whether or not they met rigorous diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability autism spectrum disorderintellectual disability autism spectrum disorderintellectual disability autism spectrum disorderintellectual disability and autism spectrum disorderintellectual disability Temporally ordered multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the information conveyed by perinatal factors about increased risk for autism spectrum disorder andor intellectual disability autism spectrum disorderintellectual disability autism spectrum disorderintellectual disability and autism spectrum disorderintellectual disability In all 889 of 966 92 children recruited were assessed at age 10 years of whom 857 96 were assessed for autism spectrum disorder of these 840 98 children were assessed for intellectual disability Autism spectrum...

  Chunk: Abstract: Lower gestational age may increase autism spectrum disorder ASD vulnerability however the incidence of ASD diagnosis through a direct assessment on every very preterm birth child on the population base remains unclear Moreover the behavioral characteristics of preterm birth ASD are unknown Every very preterm birth child gestational age 32 weeks birth weight 1500 g who was discharged from neonatal intensive care units in Southern Taiwan and prospectively followed to 5 years of age was evaluated using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ADOS and the Autism Diagnostic InterviewRevised ADIR The term birth gestational age 37 weeks ASD children characterized by ADOS and ADIR were group matched to the preterm birth ASD by age at examination for comparison ADOS severity scores were calculated by the MannWhitney iUi test and ADIR by multivariate analysis of variance and canonical discriminant analysis Two hundred fortysix 87 of the 283 very preterm survivors were followed prospectively to 5 years of age Nineteen 77 of the 246 children fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of ASD After excluding 1 patient with cerebral palsy and profound mental disability 18 preterm ASD children were compared with 44 term birth ASD children The two ASD groups were comparable for age at examination gender and intelligence quotient The two groups showed comparable ADOS severity scores in social affect deficits restricted repetitive behaviors and total score but had differences in qualitative abnormalities in reciprocal social interaction Wilks lambda iFi value 62 iPi 0001 of ADIR Compared to term birth ASD children preterm birth ASD children exhibited worse nonverbal behaviors that regulate social interaction OR 259 95 CI 141473 iPi 0002 but more favorable peer relationships OR 058 95 CI 038090 iPi 001 and socioemotional reciprocity OR 055 95 CI 033092 iPi 002 In contrast to the heterogeneous severity of social reciprocity in the term ASD group the behavioral characteristics of the preterm ASD group showed a homogeneous reciprocal social interaction pattern The 5year incidence rate of ASD was high in very preterm birth children Preterm birth...
