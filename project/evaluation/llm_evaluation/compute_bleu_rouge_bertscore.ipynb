       "0   Based on the provided context, the answer is \"Yes.\" According to the abstract, two-thirds of the children with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) experienced residual problems at long-term follow-up, with cognitive problems in areas of executive function and working memory being the most prevalent. Therefore, it appears that an incomplete recovery is a common outcome for these children.   \n",
