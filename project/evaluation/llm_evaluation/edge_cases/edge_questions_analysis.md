# Chatbot Edge Questions Analysis


## Explanation of Analysis

This document provides an analysis of how a medical chatbot handles a variety of "edge case" questions. These questions fall into different categories, such as unrelated queries, queries in other languages, one-word queries, very long queries, poorly structured queries, and medical-related queries. The chatbot's responses are evaluated based on three different similarity score thresholds (0.75, 0.80, 0.85) to determine how these thresholds affect the chatbot's ability to provide relevant answers or admit lack of knowledge by responding with "I don't know".

### Key Points:

- **Summary Table:** Shows the count of questions in each category for them at least one document retrieved by the retriever so that were answered without resorting to "Sorry, but I don't know as my capabilities are focused on medical assistance", across different similarity score thresholds. This helps in understanding which similarity threshold provides the best balance between providing answers and acknowledging when it cannot provide a relevant response.

- **Detailed Responses:** Lists each question along with the chatbot's response and the number of source documents retrieved (if any), for each similarity score threshold. This detailed breakdown allows for a closer examination of how the chatbot's performance varies not just between different categories of questions, but also how it adjusts its responses based on the similarity score.

The purpose of this analysis is to fine-tune the chatbot's parameters for optimal performance, ensuring it can handle a wide range of queries effectively, while also recognizing its limitations in certain scenarios.

- **Question:** Considering the vast array of dietary advice available online and in various health publications, ranging from plant-based diets to keto and paleo, each claiming numerous health benefits from weight loss to improved energy levels and reduced risk of chronic diseases, it's increasingly difficult to discern which diet might be the most beneficial for someone with a history of cardiovascular issues and type 2 diabetes, taking into account the need for balanced nutrition and the potential impact on blood sugar levels and heart health, leading to the question of how one should navigate these dietary recommendations to make informed decisions about managing their health.
  - **Response:**  Based on the provided context, it appears that there is ongoing research and development in the field of nutrition and dietary recommendations for managing health conditions such as cardiovascular issues and type 2 diabetes. There are various dietary approaches available, such as plant-based, keto, and paleo diets, each claiming numerous health benefits. However, navigating these recommendations can be challenging due to the need for balanced nutrition and the potential impact on blood sugar levels and heart health.

One approach to addressing this challenge is through the use of expert-informed categories and Canada's Food Guide (CFG) food groups to characterize the healthfulness of foods in long-term care settings. A novel computational algorithm was developed to categorize food items from 3-day weighed food records into 68 expert-informed categories and CFG food groups. The dietary inflammatory potential of these food sources was assessed using the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII).

Comparisons were made by sex, diet texture, and nutritional status, and consumption patterns using expert-informed categories indicated that no single protein or vegetable source was among the top 5 most commonly consumed foods. In terms of CFGs, protein food sources (such as meat, fish, dairy, and legumes) represented the highest proportion of daily calorie intake, followed by other foods (including juices, grains, and refined products), and vegetables and fruits.

Overall, the results suggest that optimizing foods aligned with the CFG and shifting to foods with anti-inflammatory potential for enhanced health benefits while balancing nutrition and ensuring sufficient food and fluid intake to prevent or treat malnutrition is a complex process that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Further research and development in this area is likely to continue, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes for individuals with various dietary needs and health conditions.

#### Medical Queries (Non Edge)
- **Question:** How do Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia impact intelligence?
  - **Response:**  Based on the provided abstracts, there is evidence to suggest that higher levels of intelligence may protect against cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia. However, the exact nature of this protection is not fully understood. Some studies suggest that cognitive reserve, which refers to education and premorbid intelligence, may play a role in protecting against AD. For example, a study found that higher premorbid intelligence was associated with a lower risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Another study found that higher education was associated with a lower risk of developing AD. However, it is important to note that these associations may be influenced by other factors, such as comorbid medical conditions and brain pathology. Therefore, further research is needed to better understand the relationship between intelligence and AD risk.

- **Question:** Can social intelligence be improved through training, and what methods are most effective?
  - **Response:**  Yes, social intelligence can be improved through training. The abstract provides evidence of an online curriculum in social intelligence (SI) that was administered with facilitation in Spanish by classroom instructors to 207 students from Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid. The program was found to significantly increase most measures of social intelligence for program participants in comparison to controls with no effects of gender or age on program effectiveness. However, the findings suggest that the program may be improved to have stronger effects.

The second abstract describes a 5-week program called MentalState Reasoning Training for Social Cognitive Impairment (SoCogMSRT) that was developed to improve social cognition in patients with schizophrenia. The study found significant improvements on a classic false belief test of Theory of Mind (ToM), self-reported measure of social understanding, and working memory and premorbid Intelligence Quotient (IQ).

The third abstract investigates the role of training-induced understanding of oneself for the enhanced understanding of others in a large-scale longitudinal study. Two independent participant samples (iNi 80 and iNi 81) received a 3-month contemplative training that focused on perspective taking and was inspired by the Internal Family Systems model. The study found that the degree to which participants improved their understanding of themselves reflected in the number of different inner parts they could identify predicted their improvements in high-level ToM performance over training.

Overall, these studies suggest that social intelligence can be improved through training, and specific methods such as online curricula, mental reasoning training, and contemplative training have shown promising results. However, further research is needed to determine the most effective methods for improving social intelligence.

- **Question:** How does the Flynn effect challenge the understanding of IQ tests over time?
  - **Response:**  The Flynn effect challenges the understanding of IQ tests over time because it suggests that IQ scores are increasing over time, resulting in norms becoming obsolete. While the Flynn effect is widely accepted, efforts to estimate its magnitude and error of measurement have been controversial and have prevented determination of factors that moderate the Flynn effect across different IQ tests. A metaanalysis was conducted to determine the magnitude of the Flynn effect with a higher degree of precision to determine the error of measurement and to assess the impact of several moderator variables on the mean effect size. The metaanalytic mean was 231.95 standard score points per decade, and the mean effect size for 53 comparisons was 293.95 IQ points per decade. However, these results did not support the hypothesis that the Flynn effect is diminishing. The Flynn effect varies significantly by age and ability level, and reverse Flynn effects have been identified in some countries. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific context and population when interpreting IQ test results.

- **Question:** I've been feeling a bit under the weather lately, starting with a mild headache that gradually became more persistent over the last week. Accompanying the headache, there's been an intermittent fever that doesn't seem to go away completely, even after taking over-the-counter fever reducers. Furthermore, I've noticed a rash that started around the same time as the fever, initially just a few spots but now spreading across my chest and back. It's not particularly itchy but is quite noticeable. Additionally, my joints, especially in the hands and knees, have been feeling stiff and sometimes painfully swollen. I've been trying to drink more fluids and rest, but there hasn't been much improvement. Given these symptoms, what might be the underlying condition, and what steps should I take next?

- **Question:** How do Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia impact intelligence?
  - **Response:**  Based on the provided abstracts, there is evidence to suggest that higher levels of intelligence may protect against cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia. However, the exact nature of this protection is not fully understood. Some studies suggest that cognitive reserve, which refers to education and premorbid intelligence, may play a role in protecting against AD. For example, a study found that higher premorbid intelligence was associated with a lower risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Another study found that higher education was associated with a lower risk of developing AD. However, it is important to note that these associations may be influenced by other factors, such as comorbid medical conditions and brain pathology. Therefore, further research is needed to better understand the relationship between intelligence and AD risk.

- **Question:** Can social intelligence be improved through training, and what methods are most effective?
  - **Response:**  Yes, social intelligence can be improved through training. The abstract provides evidence of an online curriculum in social intelligence (SI) that was administered with facilitation in Spanish by classroom instructors to 207 students from Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid. The program was found to significantly increase most measures of social intelligence for program participants in comparison to controls with no effects of gender or age on program effectiveness. However, the findings suggest that the program may be improved to have stronger effects.

The second abstract describes a 5-week program called MentalState Reasoning Training for Social Cognitive Impairment (SoCogMSRT) that was developed to improve social cognition in patients with schizophrenia. The study found significant improvements on a classic false belief test of Theory of Mind (ToM), self-reported measure of social understanding, and working memory and premorbid Intelligence Quotient (IQ).

The third abstract investigates the role of training-induced understanding of oneself for the enhanced understanding of others in a large-scale longitudinal study. Two independent participant samples (iNi 80 and iNi 81) received a 3-month contemplative training that focused on perspective taking and was inspired by the Internal Family Systems model. The study found that the degree to which participants improved their understanding of themselves reflected in the number of different inner parts they could identify predicted their improvements in high-level ToM performance over training.

Overall, these studies suggest that social intelligence can be improved through training, and specific methods such as online curricula, mental reasoning training, and contemplative training have shown promising results. However, further research is needed to determine the most effective methods for improving social intelligence.

- **Question:** How does the Flynn effect challenge the understanding of IQ tests over time?
  - **Response:**  The Flynn effect challenges the understanding of IQ tests over time because it suggests that IQ scores are increasing over time, resulting in norms becoming obsolete. While the Flynn effect is widely accepted, efforts to estimate its magnitude and error of measurement have been controversial and have prevented determination of factors that moderate the Flynn effect across different IQ tests. A metaanalysis was conducted to determine the magnitude of the Flynn effect with a higher degree of precision to determine the error of measurement and to assess the impact of several moderator variables on the mean effect size. The metaanalytic mean was 231.95 standard score points per decade, and the mean effect size for 53 comparisons was 293.95 IQ points per decade. However, these results did not support the hypothesis that the Flynn effect is diminishing. The Flynn effect varies significantly by age and ability level, and reverse Flynn effects have been identified in some countries. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific context and population when interpreting IQ test results.

- **Question:** I've been feeling a bit under the weather lately, starting with a mild headache that gradually became more persistent over the last week. Accompanying the headache, there's been an intermittent fever that doesn't seem to go away completely, even after taking over-the-counter fever reducers. Furthermore, I've noticed a rash that started around the same time as the fever, initially just a few spots but now spreading across my chest and back. It's not particularly itchy but is quite noticeable. Additionally, my joints, especially in the hands and knees, have been feeling stiff and sometimes painfully swollen. I've been trying to drink more fluids and rest, but there hasn't been much improvement. Given these symptoms, what might be the underlying condition, and what steps should I take next?
