Since recent studies have shown that α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) possesses anti-inflammatory properties, the potential therapeutic effect of AAT treatment on CFS has been investigated. A 49-year-old woman diagnosed with CFS was treated with intravenous infusions of a human plasma-derived AAT concentrate (60 mg/kg body weight weekly for 8 consecutive weeks). The patient's monocyte elastase, a regulator of inflammatory processes, was 1170 U/mg. At completion of treatment, improvement in maximal workload was observed (54.0-71.7% of predicted). Additionally, amelioration in working memory (scores: 83-94) and perceptual organization (scores: 75-83) were detected on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III test. Monocyte elastase decreased to a normal range (&lt;150 U/mg). Improvement in functional capacity allowed the patient to work in part-time employment. These findings suggest a possible role for AAT in the treatment of CFS.</td>\n",

       "1  Acute inflammation is a severe medical condition defined as an inflammatory response of the body to an infection Its rapid progression requires quick and accurate decisions from clinicians Inadequate and delayed decisions makes acute inflammation the 10th leading cause of death overall in United States with the estimated cost of treatment about 17 billion annually However despite the need there are limited number of methods that could assist clinicians to determine optimal therapies for acute inflammation We developed a datadriven method for suggesting optimal therapy by using machine learning model that is learned on historical patients behaviors To reduce both the risk of failure and the expense for clinical trials our method is evaluated on a virtual patients generated by a mathematical model that emulates inflammatory response In conducted experiments acute inflammation was handled with two complimentary pro and antiinflammatory medications which adequate timing and doses are crucial for the successful outcome Our experiments show that the dosage regimen assigned with our datadriven method significantly improves the percentage of healthy patients when compared to results by other methods used in clinical practice and found in literature Our method saved 88 of patients that would otherwise die within a week while the best method found in literature saved only 73 of patients At the same time our method used lower doses of medications than alternatives In addition our method achieved better results than alternatives when only incomplete or noisy measurements were available over time as well as it was less affected by therapy delay The presented results provide strong evidence that models from the artificial intelligence community have a potential for development of personalized treatment strategies for acute inflammation   \n",
