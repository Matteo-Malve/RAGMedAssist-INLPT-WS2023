Since recent studies have shown that α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) possesses anti-inflammatory properties, the potential therapeutic effect of AAT treatment on CFS has been investigated. A 49-year-old woman diagnosed with CFS was treated with intravenous infusions of a human plasma-derived AAT concentrate (60 mg/kg body weight weekly for 8 consecutive weeks). The patient's monocyte elastase, a regulator of inflammatory processes, was 1170 U/mg. At completion of treatment, improvement in maximal workload was observed (54.0-71.7% of predicted). Additionally, amelioration in working memory (scores: 83-94) and perceptual organization (scores: 75-83) were detected on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III test. Monocyte elastase decreased to a normal range (&lt;150 U/mg). Improvement in functional capacity allowed the patient to work in part-time employment. These findings suggest a possible role for AAT in the treatment of CFS.</td>\n",

Inadequate and delayed decisions makes acute inflammation the 10th leading cause of death overall in United States with the estimated cost of treatment about $17 billion annually. However, despite the need, there are limited number of methods that could assist clinicians to determine optimal therapies for acute inflammation.

In conducted experiments, acute inflammation was handled with two complimentary pro- and anti-inflammatory medications which adequate timing and doses are crucial for the successful outcome. Our experiments show that the dosage regimen assigned with our data-driven method significantly improves the percentage of healthy patients when compared to results by other methods used in clinical practice and found in literature. Our method saved 88% of patients that would otherwise die within a week, while the best method found in literature saved only 73% of patients. At the same time, our method used lower doses of medications than alternatives. In addition, our method achieved better results than alternatives when only incomplete or noisy measurements were available over time as well as it was less affected by therapy delay.

       "      <td>Human brain connectivity can be studied using graph theory. Many connectivity studies parcellate the brain into regions and count fibres extracted between them. The resulting network analyses require validation of the tractography, as well as region and parameter selection. Here we investigate whole brain connectivity from a different perspective. We propose a mathematical formulation based on studying the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the diffusion tensor field at the voxel level. This voxelwise matrix has over a million parameters, but we derive the Kirchhoff complexity and eigen-spectrum through elegant mathematical theorems, without heavy computation. We use these novel measures to accurately estimate the voxelwise connectivity in multiple biomedical applications such as Alzheimer's disease and intelligence prediction.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Human lifespan is positively correlated with childhood intelligence, as measured by psychometric (IQ) tests. The strength of this correlation is similar to the negative effect that smoking has on the life course. This result suggests that people who perform well on psychometric tests in childhood may remain healthier and live longer. The correlation, however, is debated: is it caused exclusively by social-environmental factors or could it also have a biological component? Biological traits of systems integrity that might result in correlations between brain function and lifespan have been suggested but are not well-established, and it is questioned what useful knowledge can come from understanding such mechanisms. In a recent study, we found a positive correlation between brain function and longevity in honey bees. Honey bees are highly social, but relevant social-environmental factors that contribute to cognition-survival correlations in humans are largely absent from insect colonies. Our results, therefore, suggest a biological explanation for the correlation in the bee. Here, we argue that individual differences in stress handling (coping) mechanisms, which both affect the bees' performance in tests of brain function and their survival could be a trait of systems integrity. Individual differences in coping are much studied in vertebrates, and several species provide attractive models. Here, we discuss how pigs are an interesting model for studying behavioural, physiological and molecular mechanisms that are recruited during stress and that can drive correlations between health, cognition and longevity traits. By revealing biological factors that make individuals susceptible to stress, it might be possible to alleviate health and longevity disparities in people.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Physicians, in order to study the causes of cancer, detect cancer earlier, prevent or determine the effectiveness of treatment, and specify the reasons for the treatment ineffectiveness, need to access accurate, comprehensive, and timely cancer data. The cancer care environment has become more complex because of the need for coordination and communication among health care professionals with different skills in a variety of roles and the existence of large amounts of data with various formats. The goals of health care systems in such a complex environment are correct health data management, providing appropriate information needs of users to enhance the integrity and quality of health care, timely access to accurate information and reducing medical errors. These roles in new systems with use of agents efficiently perform well. Because of the potential capability of agent systems to solve complex and dynamic health problems, health care system, in order to gain full advantage of E- health, steps must be taken to make use of this technology. Multi-agent systems have effective roles in health service quality improvement especially in telemedicine, emergency situations and management of chronic diseases such as cancer. In the design and implementation of agent based systems, planning items such as information confidentiality and privacy, architecture, communication standards, ethical and legal aspects, identification opportunities and barriers should be considered. It should be noted that usage of agent systems only with a technical view is associated with many problems such as lack of user acceptance. The aim of this commentary is to survey applications, opportunities and barriers of this new artificial intelligence tool for cancer care information as an approach to improve cancer care management.</td>\n",

Many connectivity studies parcellate the brain into regions and count fibres extracted between them. The resulting network analyses require validation of the tractography, as well as region and parameter selection. Here we investigate whole brain connectivity from a different perspective. We propose a mathematical formulation based on studying the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the diffusion tensor field at the voxel level. This voxelwise matrix has over a million parameters, but we derive the Kirchhoff complexity and eigen-spectrum through elegant mathematical theorems, without heavy computation. We use these novel measures to accurately estimate the voxelwise connectivity in multiple biomedical applications such as Alzheimer's disease and intelligence prediction.   \n",
       "3                                                                                        Human lifespan is positively correlated with childhood intelligence, as measured by psychometric (IQ) tests. The strength of this correlation is similar to the negative effect that smoking has on the life course. This result suggests that people who perform well on psychometric tests in childhood may remain healthier and live longer. The correlation, however, is debated: is it caused exclusively by social-environmental factors or could it also have a biological component? Biological traits of systems integrity that might result in correlations between brain function and lifespan have been suggested but are not well-established, and it is questioned what useful knowledge can come from understanding such mechanisms. In a recent study, we found a positive correlation between brain function and longevity in honey bees. Honey bees are highly social, but relevant social-environmental factors that contribute to cognition-survival correlations in humans are largely absent from insect colonies. Our results, therefore, suggest a biological explanation for the correlation in the bee. Here, we argue that individual differences in stress handling (coping) mechanisms, which both affect the bees' performance in tests of brain function and their survival could be a trait of systems integrity. Individual differences in coping are much studied in vertebrates, and several species provide attractive models. Here, we discuss how pigs are an interesting model for studying behavioural, physiological and molecular mechanisms that are recruited during stress and that can drive correlations between health, cognition and longevity traits. By revealing biological factors that make individuals susceptible to stress, it might be possible to alleviate health and longevity disparities in people.   \n",
       "4                                                         Physicians, in order to study the causes of cancer, detect cancer earlier, prevent or determine the effectiveness of treatment, and specify the reasons for the treatment ineffectiveness, need to access accurate, comprehensive, and timely cancer data. The cancer care environment has become more complex because of the need for coordination and communication among health care professionals with different skills in a variety of roles and the existence of large amounts of data with various formats. The goals of health care systems in such a complex environment are correct health data management, providing appropriate information needs of users to enhance the integrity and quality of health care, timely access to accurate information and reducing medical errors. These roles in new systems with use of agents efficiently perform well. Because of the potential capability of agent systems to solve complex and dynamic health problems, health care system, in order to gain full advantage of E- health, steps must be taken to make use of this technology. Multi-agent systems have effective roles in health service quality improvement especially in telemedicine, emergency situations and management of chronic diseases such as cancer. In the design and implementation of agent based systems, planning items such as information confidentiality and privacy, architecture, communication standards, ethical and legal aspects, identification opportunities and barriers should be considered. It should be noted that usage of agent systems only with a technical view is associated with many problems such as lack of user acceptance. The aim of this commentary is to survey applications, opportunities and barriers of this new artificial intelligence tool for cancer care information as an approach to improve cancer care management.   \n",

       "1  Acute inflammation is a severe medical condition defined as an inflammatory response of the body to an infection Its rapid progression requires quick and accurate decisions from clinicians Inadequate and delayed decisions makes acute inflammation the 10th leading cause of death overall in United States with the estimated cost of treatment about 17 billion annually However despite the need there are limited number of methods that could assist clinicians to determine optimal therapies for acute inflammation We developed a datadriven method for suggesting optimal therapy by using machine learning model that is learned on historical patients behaviors To reduce both the risk of failure and the expense for clinical trials our method is evaluated on a virtual patients generated by a mathematical model that emulates inflammatory response In conducted experiments acute inflammation was handled with two complimentary pro and antiinflammatory medications which adequate timing and doses are crucial for the successful outcome Our experiments show that the dosage regimen assigned with our datadriven method significantly improves the percentage of healthy patients when compared to results by other methods used in clinical practice and found in literature Our method saved 88 of patients that would otherwise die within a week while the best method found in literature saved only 73 of patients At the same time our method used lower doses of medications than alternatives In addition our method achieved better results than alternatives when only incomplete or noisy measurements were available over time as well as it was less affected by therapy delay The presented results provide strong evidence that models from the artificial intelligence community have a potential for development of personalized treatment strategies for acute inflammation   \n",
