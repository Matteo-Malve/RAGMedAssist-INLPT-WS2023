      "['The contribution of genomics and associated technologies to human health risk assessment for environmental chemicals has focused largely on elucidating mechanisms of toxicity, as discussed in other articles in this issue. However, there is interest in moving beyond hazard characterization to making more direct impacts on quantitative risk assessment (QRA)--i.e., the determination of toxicity values for setting exposure standards and cleanup values. We propose that the evolution of QRA of environmental chemicals in the post-genomic era will involve three, somewhat overlapping phases in which different types of approaches begin to mature. The initial focus (in Phase I) has been and continues to be on \"augmentation\" of weight of evidence--using genomic and related technologies qualitatively to increase the confidence in and scientific basis of the results of QRA. Efforts aimed towards \"integration\" of these data with traditional animal-based approaches, in particular quantitative predictors, or surrogates, for the in vivo toxicity data to which they have been anchored are just beginning to be explored now (in Phase II). In parallel, there is a recognized need for \"expansion\" of the use of established biomarkers of susceptibility or risk of human diseases and disorders for QRA, particularly for addressing the issues of cumulative assessment and population risk. Ultimately (in Phase III), substantial further advances could be realized by the development of novel molecular and pathway-based biomarkers and statistical and in silico models that build on anticipated progress in understanding the pathways of human diseases and disorders. Such efforts would facilitate a gradual \"reorientation\" of QRA towards approaches that more directly link environmental exposures to human outcomes.', 'An old issue in psychological assessment is to what extent power and speed each are measured by a given intelligence test. Starting from accuracy and response time data, an approach based on posterior time limits (cut-offs of recorded response time) leads to three kinds of recoded data: time data (whether or not the response precedes the cut-off), time-accuracy data (whether or not a response is correct and precedes the cut-off), and accuracy data (as time-accuracy data, but coded as missing when not preceding the time cut-off). Each type of data can be modeled as binary responses. Speed and power are investigated through the effect of posterior time limits on two main aspects: (a) the latent variable that is measured: whether it is more power-related or more speed-related; (b) how well the latent variable (of whatever kind) is measured through the item(s). As empirical data, we use responses and response times for a verbal analogies test. The main findings are that, independent of the posterior time limit, basically the same latent speed trait was measured through the time data, and basically the same latent power trait was measured through the accuracy data, while for the time-accuracy data the nature of the latent trait moved from power to speed when the posterior time limit was reduced. It was also found that a reduction of the posterior time limit had no negative effect on the reliability of the latent trait measures (of whatever kind).', 'Central coherence refers to an in-built propensity to form meaningful links over a wide range of stimuli and to generalize over as wide a range of contexts as possible. In children with autism this ability is diminished, and the impact of central coherence deficits in children with autism have previously been observed using static measures of learning, such as reading comprehension test performance. In this study, the relationship between central coherence and more dynamic indicators of learning are investigated. The responses of 52 children with autism (mean age 9:10 years) on a test of central coherence and a dynamic assessment task were analysed. All the children showed significant improvements in dynamic assessment test scores after mediation; however, among those with below average nonverbal intelligence scores, weak central coherence was significantly associated with smaller gains in performance after teaching. Implications for the validity of dynamic assessments for children with autism are discussed.']\n"

      "Does general intelligence exist across species, and has it been a target of natural selection? These questions can be addressed with genomic data, which can rule out artifacts by demonstrating that distinct cognitive abilities are genetically correlated and thus share a biological substrate. This work has begun with data from humans and can be extended to other species; it should focus not only on general intelligence but also specific capacities like language and spatial ability.\n",

      "Burkart et al. consider that the relationship between general intelligence and socio-cognitive abilities is poorly understood in animals and humans. We examine this conclusion in the perspective of an already substantial evidence base on the relationship among general intelligence, theory of mind, and emotional intelligence. We propose a link between general intelligence and socio-cognitive abilities within humans.\n",

      "The brain is an information machine equipped with mind and consciousness, acquired through a long history of evolution. Artificial intelligence (AI) aims at the development of intelligent functions in computers. We show mechanisms of deep learning in AI, and compare them with brain functions. In particular, we consider the function of consciousness in the brain, and its relation to AI. Mathematical neuroscience provides a powerful method to both AI and brain science. We conclude by emphasizing that further interactions are important for both AI and brain science.\n",

      "Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong physical and emotional challenge. The concept of emotional intelligence may offer better understanding of personal resources facilitating management of such challenges. We therefore hypothesized that emotional intelligence will negatively associate with two measures of diabetic management: HA1c and blood sugar levels. A total of 78 young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus reported their last HA1c test result and their blood sugar level, as well as demographics and took the audio-visual test of emotional intelligence. The results showed a negative association between emotional intelligence and HA1c and marginal results in the same direction with blood sugar levels even when controlling for demographics.\n",

      "Individuals with intellectual disability (ID) and traumatic brain injury experience mental health issues at a higher rate than the general population. They are typically more vulnerable to stress, have fewer coping skills, and possess a smaller system of natural supports. It is clear that level of intelligence is not the sole indicator of the appropriateness of psychotherapy and that the full range of mental health services are able to help improve the quality of life for patients with intellectual disability. Special issues related to motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and supportive psychotherapy are described with specific attention to special issues for the intellectual disability population and effective adaptations addressed.\n",

      "The concept of Emotional Intelligence (EI) was developed as a way to evaluate and highlight the importance of emotional health as it relates to overall quality of life. This study examines the predictive nature of EI with standardized measures of mental health to create a model that can be utilized to create more effective health promotion interventions. Step-wise multiple regression was used to predict mental health (Kessler K-6 scale) and Type D personality (Denollett's Scale of Negative Affectivity and Social Inhibition) with five dimensions of EI. The results revealed that while not all of the dimensions of EI regressed significantly in each model, mood management was highly predictive of all mental health measures under investigation. Cut-off points for each scale were also helpful in interpreting the relatedness of EI to mental health.\n",
