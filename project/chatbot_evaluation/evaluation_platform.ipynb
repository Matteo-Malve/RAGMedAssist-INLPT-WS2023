Additionally, adjusting for confounding genetic factors using polygenic risk scores for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia did not affect the associations.

       "Football is a popular sport around the world with an estimated global following of 40 billion fans. It involves two teams competing against each other to score goals by kicking a ball into the opposing team's net. The result of the game determines the performance of both the team and individual players. Players need to train smart to prevent career-ending injuries. Football has now incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) as a teammate to players and assistant coach. Coaches use AI and incorporate it into traditional training methods. The Football Association has already implemented sensors to collect data, such as Video Assistant Referee and Goal Line Technology, to improve the quality of players and coaches. The proposed algorithm compares with the fuzzy logic model FLM and finds that it is 72% more accurate at predicting outcomes than the current system.\n",

       "2. How does women's football differ from men's football? \n",
       "Women's football is gaining popularity globally, but there are still some differences between the two sports. One key difference is play accuracy - women tend to perform better in terms of scoring goals. Another difference is the recovery time of ball possession, where women recover faster than men. Lastly, women's football tends to have higher overall performance quality compared to men's football. Understanding these differences can help journalists and fans appreciate the unique aspects of women's football and assist coaches in designing strategies specifically tailored to female teams.\n",

       "Studies have shown that children who play flag football have slightly lower injury rates compared to those who play tackle football. However, it is not clear whether this difference is due to the different ways each type of football is played or taught, or if there are inherent differences in attitudes or neuropsychological characteristics among children and their parents. Further research is needed to determine the underlying causes of these differences.\n",

       "Football is a very popular sport all around the world. In fact, there are billions of fans who love watching and playing football! People of different ages enjoy this exciting game. When a football match ends, it determines how well the team and individual players performed. However, sometimes injuries can happen during the game, which can end someone's career. That's why it's important for players to train smartly and take precautions to prevent these injuries.\n",

       "Did you know that even football is now entering the new era of artificial intelligence (AI)? Just like in other industries, AI is being used in football too! AI acts like a teammate to the players and helps them improve their skills. It also assists the coaches in making better strategies. Some Football Associations have started implementing sensors to collect data during games. For example, they use Video Assistant Referee and Goal Line Technology to make sure everything is fair and accurate. By incorporating AI into training methods, both the players' abilities and the coaching techniques are enhanced.\n",

       "Now let's talk about women's football. It is becoming more and more popular among girls and women all over the world. But did you know that there are some differences between men's and women's football? Even though the players might look similar, there are certain things that make women's football unique. One interesting thing is that women tend to focus more on accuracy when playing the game. They try to pass the ball precisely to their teammates instead of taking risky shots at the goal. Another difference is the recovery time of ball possession. Women usually recover faster after losing control of the ball compared to men. Lastly, women's performance quality is generally considered to be higher than men's.\n",

       "Some researchers wanted to find out if these differences exist because of the way the games are played or if there are other factors involved. So, they conducted a study where they analyzed the gameplay of both men's and women's football matches. They trained an artificial intelligence model to identify if a team was male or female just by looking at the actions happening on the field. The results showed that the model was able to distinguish between men's and women's football quite accurately. This means that there are indeed some key technical differences between the two genders.\n",
