### Member contributions
Please refer to Asana, the task manager we used over the course of all the project. All the tasks are unpacked and are labeled with whom was in charge to complete them. The access was granted to our supervisor during the project. \
We will like to specify that the group had a good chemistry and we all worked together to the final goal, helping each other out and coordinating efficiently when some tasks were dependent on others.

The goal of the project is to build a chatbot with access to the Pubmed datataset, which can be able to answer user question in open text format. The target audience for our project is [...]

The latter was supported by a big evaluation process, distinguished in two phases: quantitative and qualitative. More detailes are recorded in section 3 and in the README of the evaluation folder.
